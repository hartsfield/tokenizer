<p><em><strong>By Erica C. Barnett</strong></em></p>
<p>The director of King County&#8217;s Department of Adult and Juvenile Detention (DADJ), Allen Nance, has asked the state supreme court to rescind a rule barring local courts from issuing warrants against and jailing young people who violate court orders or fail to appear in court, unless the child poses a &#8220;serious threat to public safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>The court <a href="https://www.courts.wa.gov/court_rules/pdf/JuCR/SUP_JuCR_7_16_00.pdf">issued the rule</a> in 2020 to reduce crowding in youth jails and made it permanent in 2021, sparking immediate pushback from judges and juvenile court administrators, who <a href="https://www.courts.wa.gov/court_rules/?fa=court_rules.proposedRuleDisplay&amp;ruleId=6044">argued</a> that judges need discretion to jail young people for their own good and so that they won&#8217;t commit more crimes in their communities.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.courts.wa.gov/court_Rules/proposed/2022Jul/1465%20JuCR%207.16/Allen%20A.%20Nance%20-%20JuCR%207.16.pdf">letter</a> to the court in April, Nance argued that judges are &#8220;uniquely situated to make informed decisions regarding the need for temporary custody of a youth following the issuance of a bench warrant and once a youth is brought before the court to have the warrant served or quashed, because they &#8220;often know the youth, their family, and social histories or have the expertise to obtain the information they need to help determine the presence of urgent and immediate necessity for a custodial response.&#8221;</p>
<p>For example, Nance continued, a young person may need to be held in jail because their parents &#8220;do not know where their son or daughter has been living or what challenges they face outside the home&#8221;—challenges that could include &#8220;the deadly effects of substances [such as fentanyl] that are readily accessible to youth and permeate our communities.&#8221; Although &#8220;most youth do not require custodial supervision and incarceration,&#8221; Nance wrote, &#8220;for a subset of the youth who come before juvenile court judges, a decision to issue a bench warrant or order custody may mean the difference between life and death.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Department of Adult and Juvenile Detention did not respond to questions in time for PubliCola&#8217;s deadline, but we will update this post when we hear back.</p>
<p>Anita Khandelwal, who directs the county&#8217;s Department of Public Defense, says if the court gets rid of the rule restricting warrants for youth who don&#8217;t pose an imminent threat, the most likely outcome is a return to pre-COVID policy, in which judges issued warrants &#8220;<span class="m_3038401539163207378normaltextrun">without examining whether the youth posed a serious threat to public safety,&#8221; including situations where &#8220;a youth didn’t come to court or wasn’t at home when they were supposed to be.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span class="m_3038401539163207378normaltextrun">The result, she says, will be a spike in warrants and youth incarceration, especially for young people of color; in 2019, before the court issued the rule, between 82 and 84 percent of warrants issued by</span><span class="m_3038401539163207378normaltextrun"> King County Juvenile Court judges in 2019 were for youth of color, according to Khandelwal.</span></p>
<p>In a <a href="https://publicola.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Letter-in-Support-of-Maintaining-JuCR-7.16.pdf">letter</a> asking state Supreme Court Chief Justice Steven González to maintain the rule, dozens of advocates and defense attorneys argued that incarcerating young people harms their physical and mental health, disrupts their education, and worsens the racial disproportionality of the entire criminal legal system. &#8220;Because the juvenile legal system is entangled with many other institutions that have perpetuated racist practices like policing, housing, education, and employment discrimination, limiting the circumstances under which a youth can be incarcerated due to a warrant in a juvenile offense proceeding protects our youth and enables a more racially just future,&#8221; the letter says.</p>
<p>King County, under County Executive Dow Constantine, has vowed to <a href="https://publicola.com/2021/03/17/whats-next-in-king-countys-path-to-ending-youth-detention/">shut down the youth jail</a> by 2025, although that pledge has been <a href="https://publicola.com/2022/08/31/isolation-crowding-in-youth-jail-increase-as-deadline-for-closure-looms/">coupled</a> with an <a href="https://publicola.com/2022/10/04/fewer-staff-more-incarcerated-kids-and-frequent-solitary-confinement-as-youth-jail-closure-deadline-approaches/">increase</a> in youth incarceration and worsening conditions at the facility. So far this year, an average of 34 kids are incarcerated at the Clark Children and Family Justice Center in Seattle every day, an increase of almost 20 percent over  .</p>
<p>In a letter to Khandelwal, Constantine&#8217;s labor relations director, Megan Pedersen, said the county executive &#8220;has always empowered county leaders to weigh in on policy matters based on their operational vantage point and subject matter expertise. &#8230; This issue highlights the complexity we navigate with criminal justice issues within the Executive Branch given competing policy objectives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Khandelwal has asked to add Nance&#8217;s letter to the agenda for the next meeting of the county&#8217;s Care and Closure Advisory Committee, which makes recommendations on a path to closing down the youth jail; <a href="https://publicinput.com/cfjcstrategicplan2025#3">that meeting</a> will be on Monday, June 24 at 4pm.</p>

	<p><strong>1. </strong>As of last week, the Seattle City Council seemed likely to vote at least 5-4 in favor of <a href="https://publicola.com/2023/06/02/despite-concerns-seattle-council-is-poised-to-criminalize-drug-possession-and-use-in-seattle/">legislation</a>, proposed by City Attorney Ann Davison and sponsored by Councilmembers Sara Nelson and Alex Pedersen, to criminalize simple drug possession and public use at the city level. The state legislature, responding to a state supreme court decision overturning the state&#8217;s previous felony law, made drug use and possession a gross misdemeanor earlier this year; the local proposal would incorporate parts of that law into the city&#8217;s municipal code.</p>

If Councilmembers Teresa Mosqueda, Tammy Morales, Kshama Sawant, and Lisa Herbold all vote &#8220;no,&#8221; all it will take is one more council member—either Andrew Lewis or Dan Strauss, both up for reelection this year—to doom the bill.</p>
<p>Lewis declined to comment on Monday, and Strauss did not respond to a text message last week. However, Strauss proposed an <a href="https://seattle.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&amp;ID=12065122&amp;GUID=83001A30-24DC-4ABC-BC5F-65D4545D906E">amendment</a> on Monday that would add a &#8220;whereas&#8221; clause the bill pointing out that the state law mentions diversion, treatment, and services as alternatives to booking and prosecution, suggesting that he may believe the new law meaningfully encourages these alternatives.</p>
<p>If Strauss supports the bill, the decision would come down to Lewis. Although Lewis told the <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/meet-the-candidates-for-seattles-district-7-city-council-race/">Seattle Times</a> he supports prosecuting people for public drug use, that was before Davison withdrew the city from community court. In light of that decision, Lewis may want to avoid handing more authority to a separately elected official who has demonstrated she will act unilaterally to penalize low-level crimes. During Monday&#8217;s council briefing, Lewis criticized Davison&#8217;s decision, saying it was &#8220;concerning that the decision to pull out and disrupt that program has been made without a well-thought–out plan on what replaces it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The criminalization bill skipped past the usual committee hearing, so tomorrow&#8217;s 2 pm full council meeting will be the first time the council discusses the legislation publicly, and the first and last opportunity for the public to address the council directly before the vote.</p>

<p><strong>2. </strong>Former King County Regional Homelessness Authority CEO Marc Dones, who <a href="https://publicola.com/2023/05/30/with-the-departure-of-founding-ceo-dones-what-comes-next-for-the-regions-homelessness-agency/">announced</a> their resignation last month, will reportedly receive a public contract to work on an unspecified project for the agency for up to three months after their last day on June 16. Sources close to Dones and the agency were tight-lipped about the details, but the deal is said to be a kind of payment in lieu of severance because Dones decided to resign rather than forcing the agency to fire them, which was starting to look more and more likely in the weeks leading up to Dones&#8217; resignation.</p>
<p>Dones has been a divisive figure, winning praise for their big-picture vision and efforts to include people with direct experience in decisions that impact them directly, along with criticism for neglecting ground-level details, like building relationships with existing service providers and <a href="https://publicola.com/2023/05/11/homeless-service-providers-many-unpaid-since-last-year-demand-reforms/">paying contractors on time</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear exactly where the money for Dones&#8217; potential contract would come from, and whether it would require them to be physically present at KCRHA headquarters at the same time that an interim director, Helen Howell, is working to establish a new course for the agency. A representative for King County declined to comment on the details of the potential contract, and a representative for Harrell did not respond to an email, a phone call, or a text message seeking comment.</p>

<p><em><strong>By Erica C. Barnett</strong></em></p>
<p>Next Tuesday, the Seattle City Council could adopt <a href="https://seattle.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6230573&amp;GUID=03F0A967-4B46-4179-8EBC-C6D488D7ED81&amp;FullText=1">legislation</a> to incorporate parts of a new state law criminalizing public drug use and simple possession, adopted during a short special session earlier this year, into the city&#8217;s municipal code. The proposal, sponsored by City Councilmembers Sara Nelson and Alex Pedersen and backed by City Attorney Ann Davison, would empower the city attorney&#8217;s office to prosecute people for possessing or using illegal drugs for the first time in the city&#8217;s history.</p>
<p>The legislature adopted the<a href="https://publicola.com/2023/05/17/finally-addressing-blake-decision-legislature-passes-punitive-drug-possession-bill/"> new law,</a> which makes public drug use and simple possession a gross misdemeanor, during a special session earlier this year. The law is a response to a state supreme court decision known as <em>State v. Blake</em>, which overturned a state law making simple drug possession a felony. The legislature passed a temporary law making possession a felony while it hashed out a more comprehensive proposal, which passed during a special session this year. The new law makes drug possession and public use a misdemeanor, effectively bumping drug cases down from King County Prosecutor Leesa Manion&#8217;s office to Davison.</p>
<p>If the council doesn&#8217;t pass the new law, Manion would still have the authority to charge drug misdemeanors in addition to felonies, but is unlikely to do so; in a letter to council members, Manion said that even if her office &#8220;magically had the staff and resources necessary to take on a new body of work, we would focus those resources on felony prosecutions because the PAO has misdemeanor and gross misdemeanor jurisdiction in only unincorporated areas of King County.  &#8230; The City Attorney’s Office is better equipped to handle these cases immediately[.]&#8221;</p>
<p>During the year-long period when drug possession was a felony, Manion&#8217;s office only prosecuted two possession cases, according to an <a href="https://publicola.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Memo-Posession-and-Public-Use-CB-120586-20230601.pdf">analysis</a> by city council central staff. That same analysis says that although Davison&#8217;s office &#8220;has not explicitly stated how they would act upon the authority to charge knowing possession or use of illegal or controlled substances,&#8221; a Seattle Municipal Court analysis estimates an additional 700 to 870 cases a year, &#8220;based on historical filings before the COVID-19 pandemic&#8221; and the state&#8217;s own estimate of 12,000 new drug cases annually across the state.</p>
<div class="perfect-pullquote vcard pullquote-align-full pullquote-border-placement-left"><blockquote><p>In a <a href="https://dpd-seiu925.org/2023/05/26/seiu-925-letter-to-seattle-city-council-re-criminalizing-drug-use/">letter to the council</a>, the union representing King County Department of Public Defense employees, SEIU 925, called the legislation &#8220;an unconscionable abuse by the City Prosecutor, which dismisses solid empirical evidence that the War on Drugs and increased incarceration cause widespread harm throughout our community.</p></blockquote></div>
<p>How the new proposals will play out in practice, if they pass, is a matter of significant debate. Opponents say they will empower police to do &#8220;stop and frisk&#8221; searches and arrest drug users with impunity, clogging up courtrooms and crowding the understaffed county jail. Proponents say the changes will create consequences for people committing crimes and—as Nelson put it in a press statement—&#8221;remove any further cause for inaction on the most critical public health and public safety issue of our time.” A third group—let&#8217;s call them reluctant proponents—argue that the new laws won&#8217;t have much impact, because the city hasn&#8217;t prioritized drug cases in the past and shows no sign of changing course now.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://dpd-seiu925.org/2023/05/26/seiu-925-letter-to-seattle-city-council-re-criminalizing-drug-use/">letter to the council</a>, the union representing King County Department of Public Defense employees, SEIU 925, called the legislation &#8220;an unconscionable abuse by the City Prosecutor, which dismisses solid empirical evidence that the War on Drugs and increased incarceration cause widespread harm throughout our community.&#8221; Criminalizing drug use at the local level, the letter continued, &#8220;would create the same dynamic within SPD which led to the New York Police Department’s ‘stop and frisk’ programs,&#8221; which &#8220;ultimately led to a class-action lawsuit from public defenders in New York on behalf of their clients.&#8221; The letter was signed by all four SEIU chapters in Seattle.</p>
<p>During an online &#8220;emergency teach-in&#8221; to discuss the proposal on Tuesday, Drug Policy Alliance director Kassandra Frederique said the pressure to re-criminalize drugs in Seattle was part of a nationwide trend toward more punitive approaches to drug use and addiction. &#8220;Not only are we criminalizing, or re-litigating, issues that we have decided were inappropriate [for criminalization], we are now creating new crimes in order as a way to deal with the issues at hand,&#8221; Frederique said.</p>

<p>A majority of the City Council would probably agree that criminalizing drugs is not the best approach to the rising number of people using and selling drugs in public. However, the legislation may pass with a slim majority, if Councilmembers Andrew Lewis and Dan Strauss—both up for reelection this year—join Nelson, Pedersen, and Council President Debora Juarez in voting for the law. Both were reportedly still considering their votes this weekend.</p>
<p>Why would council members vote for a law criminalizing drug use in Seattle? Politics. Three council incumbents are up for reelection this year, and two—Andrew Lewis and Dan Strauss—are facing challenges from the right that could push them into voting for the law to avoid handing political fodder to their opponents. (Tammy Morales, in District 2, is also up for reelection but has already said she will vote against the bill). Although neither Strauss nor Lewis has said publicly how they plan to vote—in a recent candidate questionnaire, Strauss <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/meet-the-candidates-for-seattles-district-6-city-council-race/">told the Seattle Times</a> he was a &#8220;maybe&#8221; on the law—if they were to vote against the bill, opponents aligned with Davison and Nelson could blame them, and the council generally,  for tying the city attorney&#8217;s hands and allowing open drug use to continue. The campaign ads practically write themselves.</p>
<div class="perfect-pullquote vcard pullquote-align-full pullquote-border-placement-left"><blockquote><p>While it&#8217;s true that the city generally incorporates new state laws into its code, the proposed criminalization bill itself actually breaks from that convention, by picking and choosing which parts of the state law the city should adopt. </p></blockquote></div>
<p>On Tuesday, expect to hear the argument that it would be highly unusual for the council <em>not</em> to incorporate new state laws into its municipal code, and the counter-argument that refusing to criminalize drug possession at the local level sends an important message that Seattle&#8217;s priorities are different than the state&#8217;s.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s true that the city generally incorporates new state laws into its code, the proposed criminalization bill itself actually breaks from that convention, by picking and choosing which parts of the state law the city should adopt. According to the council staff analysis, the ordinance &#8220;only adopts some portions of the state bill&#8221; because some of the provisions include &#8220;work that SPD and CAO are not focused upon.&#8221; So the council does have, and is already exercising, discretion when it decides whether to make local laws conform with the state&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Even the bill&#8217;s proponents have <a href="https://publicola.com/2023/04/27/proposal-to-make-public-drug-use-a-misdemeanor-unlikely-to-have-much-visible-impact/">acknowledged</a> that the police and courts are unlikely to prioritize low-level drug cases over more serious misdemeanors, such as domestic violence and DUI; the Seattle Police Department is currently hundreds of officers shy of its hiring goals, and the city attorney&#8217;s office, county public defense department, and Seattle Municipal Court are also short-staffed.</p>
<p>The state law encourages prosecutors to refer defendants t diversion and treatment programs, but that would require additional funding beyond what the city has already provided for new adult pre-trial diversion programs. (The funding has been sitting at the Human Services Department, unspent, since the council allocated it in 2021.) The city attorney&#8217;s office has said it plans to use those diversion funds, once they&#8217;re available, for a different purpose: Taking on cases that would have gone to community court, a therapeutic court from which Davison <a href="https://publicola.com/2023/05/26/davison-unilaterally-ends-community-court-program/">unilaterally withdrew the cit</a>y last week.</p>
<p>&#8220;Building out the needed infrastructure to be able to address root causes of these issues and get individuals into treatment and services may require time and resources,&#8221; the central staff memo notes.</p>
<p>Some—including PubliCola <a href="https://wp.me/p5ODfk-8A5">guest columnist Lisa Daugaard</a>, who argues that the outcome of the drug law debate is largely beside the point—are unconvinced that the new law will result in mass arrests, prosecutions, and jail, because the city has already reduced its alliance on punitive strategies, even before the <em>Blake</em> decision forced the legislature to pass a new state law. Mayor Harrell, Daugaard wrote, oversees SPD, &#8220;and has <a href="https://youtu.be/UTNijxPgCVU?t=3089">gone out of his way</a> to make clear that he has no intention of arresting, jail or referring drug users for prosecution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Opponents of the proposed new drug laws say that argument is short-sighted, because priorities can change, but laws are permanent. &#8220;It is extremely dangerous precedent for a bill to be passed that criminalizes [drug use] and where our elected officials try to placate advocates and community members by saying that they will that they will be able to manage it,&#8221; Frederique said during Tuesday&#8217;s teach-in. &#8220;Those people are temporary actors. Election happen all the time. And what people will look at is the law.&#8221;</p>

<p><em><strong>By Lisa Daugaard</strong></em></p>
<p>Seattle can continue to lead the country toward a productive approach to substance use and related problems. This is true no matter what happens when the City Council votes next week on a <a href="https://publicola.com/2023/05/24/council-member-wants-to-know-why-isnt-harm-reduction-abstinence-based/">proposed ordinance</a>, sponsored by Councilmembers Sara Nelson and Alex Pedersen and supported by City Attorney Ann Davison, creating gross misdemeanors under the Seattle Municipal Code for drug possession and public drug use.</p>
<p>If the ordinance is defeated, its proponents are still correct that we need far more urgency in responding to the drug crisis playing out throughout the city. If it passes, its opponents are still correct that the answer to drug-related problems does not generally lie in jailing and prosecuting people for substance use. Whatever happens next week, the work before us is the same: Take the field-leading models our community has devised to foster recovery for people who are most marginalized and exposed to the legal system, and secure the resources needed for those models to have their full impact.</p>
<p>When responding to problematic drug use, we cannot be satisfied with <a href="https://publicola.com/2023/05/24/council-member-wants-to-know-why-isnt-harm-reduction-abstinence-based/">engagement for its own sake</a>. As necessary as overdose prevention and reversal and preventing disease transmission are, they are not sufficient. We have to tackle how people are living, not just prevent deaths.</p>
<p>As a community, we have long known and broadly agreed on what can work well to respond to individuals who use substances in a problematic way: engagement without judgment; pre-booking diversion and pre-arrest referrals to intensive case management; <a href="https://coleadteam.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/JustCARE-Report_7-12-21.pdf">well-designed low barrier interim</a> and <a href="https://wearepda.org/justcare-an-analysis-of-housing-and-other-outcomes/">permanent housing</a> options for those who are living unsheltered, as well as <a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/successful-seattle-drug-treatment-program-looks-to-expand-across-king-county?fbclid=IwAR1d8iXKmvrzSS7ei33jif_n4mGxMK3a258_BXe4URIRbnPdTXYP7J-PftU">long-term case management</a> for people whose use is related to complex trauma and lack of other support systems.</p>
<p>These approaches have been branded under names such as <a href="https://wearepda.org/programs/lead-support-bureau/">LEAD</a>, <a href="https://www.desc.org/what-we-do/housing/housing-first/">Housing First</a>, <a href="https://wearepda.org/programs/justcare/">JustCARE</a>, and <a href="https://www.davepurchaseproject.org/">harm reduction</a>, but they all share elements of evidence-based, well-researched, trauma-informed care strategies and behavior change theory. Indeed, experts in our midst have quietly been teaching other communities how to implement these approaches, <a href="https://www.deseret.com/2017/12/26/20637507/lessons-from-seattle-how-this-alternative-to-jail-may-be-a-solution-for-utah">nationally</a> and <a href="https://glepha.com/marketplace-of-ideas/programme/wed-7-sep-thematic-session-2/">internationally</a>, for more than a decade.</p>
<div class="perfect-pullquote vcard pullquote-align-full pullquote-border-placement-left"><blockquote><p>Seattle led the nation in reducing arrests, jail bookings, and prosecutions for drug possession long before the 2021 Washington Supreme Court <em>Blake</em> decision. The fact that there is an ordinance authorizing arrest, jail and prosecution for an offense does not dictate that it be used in a stupid, counter-productive, and evidence-defying way</p></blockquote></div>
<p>What we have never done is bring these approaches to scale. Despite a unanimous <a href="http://clerk.seattle.gov/search/resolutions/31925">City Council resolution in 2019</a> committing Seattle to make LEAD diversion resources available in all appropriate cases, current funding limits require turning down the majority of appropriate referrals. Nor have we complemented this approach with the housing and income supports many people need to make real breakthroughs. CoLEAD and the JustCARE model, funded by temporary COVID relief dollars, began to fill that gap over the last few years, but their future is uncertain as federal relief funding recedes.</p>
<p>It is absolutely true that, all other things being equal, court cases and criminal charges tend to impede recovery, for complex reasons including stigma, collateral consequences, the challenge of making it to court, and the difficulty of making even well-intentioned lawyers into trauma-informed practitioners. Jail and the inherent trauma it represents, including lack of physical autonomy for people who have often been physically abused, almost always impedes recovery. These should not be the primary strategy or the first resort in our response to problematic drug use. Those objecting to the new proposed ordinance are right to raise these issues.</p>
<p>Yet Seattle led the nation in reducing arrests, jail bookings, and prosecutions for drug possession long before the 2021 Washington Supreme Court <em>Blake</em> decision. The fact that there is an ordinance authorizing arrest, jail and prosecution for an offense does not dictate that it be used in a stupid, counter-productive, and evidence-defying way. We made enormous progress as a community, and developed a consensus approach to these issues, while there was still a valid <em>felony</em> drug possession law in place across the state that was fully available to local officers. Police and prosecutor discretion—and the support of city and county public officials and law enforcement leaders—meant that, while the authority to jail and prosecute existed, it was rarely used.</p>
<p>Mayor Bruce Harrell, who has <a href="https://publicola.com/2023/04/17/harrell-proposes-investing-in-evidence-based-approaches-to-addiction-as-part-of-downtown-revitalization-plan/">prioritized</a> action on conditions downtown and in the Chinatown/International District, oversees the Seattle Police Department, and has <a href="https://youtu.be/UTNijxPgCVU?t=3089">gone out of his way</a> to make clear that he has no intention of arresting, jail or referring drug users for prosecution. And the authors of the new proposed ordinance making drug possession and public use a local crime were not even proposing criminalizing simple drug possession in Seattle until Governor Jay Inslee pressured the legislature to pass a law creating these crimes statewide. It’s regrettable that lawmakers removed the option of local choice, which would have resulted in de facto legalization of possession and private use in Seattle and King County. But it’s worth recalling that, before Inslee’s choice drove us down this road, Davison, Nelson, and Pedersen, to their credit, were <a href="https://publicola.com/2023/04/27/proposal-to-make-public-drug-use-a-misdemeanor-unlikely-to-have-much-visible-impact/">championing only a very narrow role for the legal system</a>.</p>

<p>We can use best practices with or without the proposed law. In six months, for example, it will be far more important whether the multi-partner <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/a-new-outreach-team-focuses-on-relieving-disorder-on-third-avenue/">Third Avenue Project</a> is still going on—and <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/third-avenue-project-seeks-to-clear-section-of-downtown/">the 400-plus people who use drugs, live unsheltered</a>, and are having a problematic impact in the Third Avenue corridor received supportive housing and intensive case management— than whether there is formal jurisdiction for the City Attorney to prosecute these two, of many, offenses that people who use substances often commit.</p>
<p>Drug possession and public use are now gross misdemeanors across the state—including in Seattle. Nothing local officials can do now can formally decriminalize either. It’s evident that some local leaders feel that taking an enforcement role completely off the table sends a message that serious drug issues are unimportant or low priority, and it’s also evident that other local officials <a href="https://twitter.com/CMTammyMorales/status/1651772438601138176">cannot stomach</a> any steps that formally invoke the prospect of criminal system consequences for what are fundamentally health and wellness issues.</p>
<p>It’s important to recognize that defeating the ordinance would not in itself represent a progressive approach to drug issues. Let’s fight hardest for what will matter most: whether we actually mobilize the community-based care approach that most people in Seattle support, go and get our people, demand the housing and income support that people need to recover, and provide the wrap-around care without which there is nearly zero chance for stabilization and healing. As it stands, regardless of whether this ordinance passes, we aren’t close to scaling the plan we need—even though we know exactly what it is.</p>

<p>After a heated public meeting Tuesday night, the Burien City Council declined to take any action on a longstanding <a href="https://publicola.com/2023/03/31/despite-community-consensus-a-longtime-burien-encampment-scatters-because-theres-nowhere-to-go/">encampment</a> on city-owned property, effectively allowing a private business that has leased the property to remove several dozen people who have been living on the site since the city <a href="https://publicola.com/2023/04/04/after-removing-encampment-burien-considers-the-options-provide-shelter-ban-camping-or-both/">forced them to move</a> from a strip of land next to City Hall in April.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve reported, the city of Burien evicted encampment residents from an area next to the building that houses both Burien City Hall and the local King County Library branch <a href="https://publicola.com/2023/04/04/after-removing-encampment-burien-considers-the-options-provide-shelter-ban-camping-or-both/">in April</a>. After encampment residents moved (legally) to a city-owned lot nearby, the city decided to <a href="https://publicola.com/2023/05/29/county-wont-participate-in-planned-sweep-of-burien-encampment-residents/">lease the property</a> for $183 a month to a nonprofit animal shelter run by the director of Discover Burien, a local business group, which says it plans to open a dog park at the site.</p>
<p>Over the course of the two-hour meeting, which was frequently interrupted by loud disruptions from an unruly crowd, the council discussed and rejected several potential resolutions, including a land swap that would involve accepting $1 million from King County and relocating encampment residents into pallet shelters on a city-owned parking lot site currently leased by a Toyota dealership, which would move the vehicles it is storing there property owned by King County Metro. The Downtown Emergency Service Center will open a new 95-unit permanent housing project in Burien later this year, with 30 percent of the units reserved for people living homeless in Burien, such as the current encampment residents.</p>
<div class="perfect-pullquote vcard pullquote-align-full pullquote-border-placement-left"><blockquote><p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know where people will choose to go. Certain sidewalks are available. The city does not have camping bans on sidewalks throughout the city. However, there are regulations that govern ADA accessibility &#8230; that the sheriff&#8217;s office has addressed in the past.&#8221;—Burien City Manager Adolfo Bailon</p></blockquote></div>
<p>As part of that deal, the encampment would move temporarily to a local Methodist Church that has agreed to host it until the city can work out a deal with the dealership, whose owner was out of town this week and apparently unaware of the discussion about his business.</p>
<p>King County floated this option during conversations with county officials, including Councilmembers Jimmy Matta and Hugo Garcia, last week. Councilmember Stephanie Mora called her colleagues &#8220;very unethical and not transparent&#8221; for talking to the county without letting the rest of the council know, leading Matta to note that as an elected official, he is allowed to meet with other government leaders.</p>
<p>Mora is a longtime encampment opponent who has unsuccessfully proposed a <a href="https://publicola.com/2023/04/04/after-removing-encampment-burien-considers-the-options-provide-shelter-ban-camping-or-both/">total ban</a> on &#8220;camping&#8221; in Burien. During Tuesday&#8217;s meeting meeting, she claimed that homeless people draw drug dealers into cities the way children draw ice cream trucks to parks in summer; in April, she opposed placing a portable toilet near the encampment, saying that homeless people should relieve themselves in <a href="https://b-townblog.com/letter-city-councilmember-says-homeless-should-poop-in-public-and-scoop-it-like-dogs/">dog waste disposal bags</a>.</p>
<p>Under a 2019 federal circuit court ruling called <em>Martin v. Boise</em>, governments can’t force homeless people to move from public property if there is no suitable shelter available. Burien has maintained that it isn&#8217;t violating <em>Boise</em> by leasing out the property and forcing people to move, because people can simply move their tents onto public sidewalks or other strips of land where they are technically allowed to be. (Burien bans people from sleeping in its parks, using a similar justification).</p>

<p>With its vote, the council also declined to consider other potential options to relocate the encampment temporarily, including other county-owned properties, or continue working on a resolution while allowing people to stay where they are. Councilmember Sarah Moore asked City Manager Adolfo Bailon to address the distinct likelihood that—as the council&#8217;s own <a href="https://burienwa.civicweb.net/document/84840/Next%20Steps%20in%20Response%20to%20King%20County%20Letter,%20D.pdf?handle=AA8A046FDABC40DD9509288D8DCA0DEB">agenda</a> noted explicitly—people would simply move onto local sidewalks since the city has not found anywhere for them to go.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know where people will choose to go,&#8221; Bailon said. &#8220;To your specific question, yes, it is possible. Certain sidewalks are available. The city does not have camping bans on sidewalks throughout the city. However, there are regulations that govern ADA accessibility &#8230; that the sheriff&#8217;s office has addressed in the past.&#8221;</p>
<p>The King County Sheriff&#8217;s Office provides Burien&#8217;s police department. Last month, King County Executive Dow Constantine&#8217;s attorney sent a letter to the city of Burien saying the sheriff&#8217;s office <a href="https://publicola.com/2023/05/29/county-wont-participate-in-planned-sweep-of-burien-encampment-residents/">would not help remove the encampment</a>, prompting the city to issue a <a href="https://www.burienwa.gov/news_events/city_newsroom/news_announcements/city_of_burien_response_to_king_county_letter">statement</a> saying it was King County&#8217;s responsibility, not the city&#8217;s, to address homelessness in the region. Burien officials opposed to the encampment have suggested repeatedly that homeless people are migrating from Seattle to Burien, but there is little evidence for this claim.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the organization placed signs around the property ordering people to vacate by June 1; <a href="https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/time-is-almost-up-people-living-burien-homeless-encampment-animal-shelter-now-leasing-lot/IWDCF4KA6RHDNI6SZXCSWSCHQE/">according to KIRO</a>, most people had vacated the encampment by early this morning.</p>

During his first run for council in 2021 against incumbent Position 9 Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda, Wilson said he was <a href="https://publicola.com/2021/10/06/mosqueda-challenger-rails-against-ghetto-type-paintings-durkan-proposes-moving-homeless-outreach-team-to-parks-department/">motivated to run</a> by crime and the presence of &#8220;ghetto-type paintings&#8221; all over the city.</p>
<p>His opponents include Maritza Rivera and Ron Davis. Rivera, a deputy director of the city&#8217;s Office of Arts and Culture whose husband, political consultant Dan Kully, worked on former mayor Jenny Durkan&#8217;s campaign, is aligned with Harrell; Davis, who contributed to Harrell&#8217;s opponent, Lorena González, is running as a progressive urbanist. Durkan contributed $300 (the legal maximum) to Rivera, her first campaign contribution since 2015, when she gave $125 to the short-lived council campaign of Mian Rice, the son of former Seattle mayor Norm Rice.</p>
<p>Wilson has raised more than any of his opponents so far—about $65,000.</p>

<p><strong>2. </strong>About 200 people showed up to see former TV star Kirk Cameron speak at the downtown Seattle Public Library last week, after the library rented a meeting room (subsequently upgraded to the main downstairs auditorium) to the former teen star. As PubliCola reported exclusively<a href="https://publicola.com/2023/05/01/seattle-library-rents-room-to-kirk-cameron-right-wing-crusader-against-woke-marxist-librarians/"> earlier this month</a>, Cameron is promoting his appearances, in which he reads from his children&#8217;s book, as &#8220;a wholesome alternative to the Drag Queen Story Hours promoted by woke Marxist librarians.”</p>
<p>Cameron has said homosexuality is “unnatural,” believes women who have abortions are “murderers,” and has said public schools are “<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tour-around-america-taught-weird-work-wicked">sexualizing</a>” and “<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kirk-cameron-homeschool_n_6296fae6e4b07aa938935237">grooming</a>” kids, a common trope among right-wing fringe groups. The library told PubliCola it would amount to &#8220;government censorship and a violation of the First Amendment&#8221; to refuse to rent a meeting room to Cameron&#8217;s group.</p>

<p>According to one attendee—who helped organize a fundraiser to raise money for pro-library organizations—Cameron started his children&#8217;s book reading by delivering a &#8220;15 minute lecture on America&#8217;s tallest granite monument.&#8221; (Cameron is so obsessed with this obscure monument, known as the Forefathers Monument, that he made a <a href="http://www.monumentalmovie.com/">documentary about it</a> (!) and even sells &#8220;high-density resin&#8221; <a href="https://store.americancampfirerevival.com/products/small-forefathers-monument">replicas</a> of it (!!) for $200 (!!!) on his website. It&#8217;s so weird it would almost be charming, if the message of the monument wasn&#8217;t that the US is meant to be an explicitly <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/11/24/how-does-foot-tall-monument-pilgrims-become-invisible/qiA2JYFS7teQ0kjhPbr9TL/story.html">Christian nation</a>).</p>
<p>After that, he brought out the Bremerton coach who won a $2 million settlement after he was fired for holding prayers on the field during football games and led the crowd in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance and singing &#8220;God Bless America&#8221; before reading two of his children&#8217;s books promoting &#8220;traditional family values.&#8221;</p>
<p>At one point, according to the attendee, &#8220;Cameron pointed to the sky and asked the audience, &#8216;who loves you the most?&#8217; and a kid in the audience yelled &#8216;Obama!'&#8221;</p>
<p>The library had security on hand, along with Seattle Police Department officers, to respond to potential protests. On Tuesday, library director Tom Fay issued a bland statement calling the event &#8220;a learning experience for all&#8221; and thanking library staff for their work to &#8220;minimize disruption and reduce the use of Library resources needed.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>By Erica C. Barnett</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When the King County Regional Homelessness Authority&#8217;s founding CEO, Marc Dones, announced they were stepping down earlier this month (news PubliCola broke on <a href="https://twitter.com/ericacbarnett/status/1658515291049959426">Twitter</a> from vacation), reactions among homeless service providers, advocates, and agency insiders ranged from sighs of relief to deep concern over what&#8217;s next for the beleaguered agency.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Over the past two years, since <a href="https://publicola.com/2021/03/11/fizz-homeless-authority-tries-again-election-update-and-a-double-standard-on-fema-funding/">Dones was hired</a> in March 2021, the KCRHA has struggled to find its footing through a series of pivots, funding battles with Seattle and King County, and internal and public debates over its mission.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Did Seattle and King County create a regional homelessness agency to solve homelessness as quickly as possible, or is the KCRHA merely a clearinghouse for homeless service contracts previously administered by Seattle and King County, its two primary funders? Should the KCRHA set regional policies and spending priorities and expect its member cities to fall in line, or should cities have freedom to establish their own strategies based on their own local politics and context? Is &#8220;housing first&#8221; a nonnegotiable goal, or is shelter, even basic shelter with mats on the floor, a critical part of the region&#8217;s approach to homelessness?</p>
<p>One thing is clear: With Dones out, there is a power vacuum at KCRHA that will be difficult to fill, in a very practical sense: Despite the usual talk of a &#8220;thorough national search,&#8221; it&#8217;s unlikely the agency will be overwhelmed with qualified applicants. Dones, readers may recall, was the second pick for the position, and ascended to the job after the KCRHA board&#8217;s first choice, Regina Cannon, <a href="https://publicola.com/2021/03/02/fizz-as-homeless-authority-regroups-citys-homelessness-division-is-at-the-breaking-point/">turned it down </a>in 2020. The position now comes pre-loaded with two years of baggage and more urgency than ever; a new CEO will need not just a big-picture vision for the region, but a plan to show swift progress on homelessness and get the authority back on track.</p>
<p>Prior to taking the CEO position, Dones was a homelessness consultant whose firm, the National Innovation Service, created the framework for the KCRHA. As the architect of the regional plan, Dones frequently fought efforts to alter it, battling with local leaders over funding priorities, questioning the expertise of longtime service providers, and expending scarce political capital on ambitious plans that didn&#8217;t always pan out—like an early proposal to make <a href="https://publicola.com/2022/05/19/homelessness-authority-asks-to-double-its-budget-money-would-fund-400-new-beds-safe-parking-worker-raises-and-day-centers/">big investments</a> in safe parking lots for the thousands of people living in their vehicles across King County.</p>
<div class="perfect-pullquote vcard pullquote-align-full pullquote-border-placement-left"><blockquote><p>Under Dones&#8217; leadership, the KCRHA established a clear picture of the homelessness problem in King County, but the agency also fell behind schedule on many of its initial goals.</p></blockquote></div>
<p>Dones&#8217; supporters praised them as a visionary who emphasized the disproportionate impact of homelessness on people of color,  particularly Black King County residents, foregrounded and empowered people with direct, &#8220;lived&#8221; experience of homelessness, and never shied away from telling the unvarnished truth about what it would take to truly end homelessness in the region. Critics said Dones elevated lived experience over practical expertise, engaged in unnecessary battles with potential allies like <a href="https://publicola.com/2022/12/16/homelessness-authority-rolls-out-2023-budget-and-five-year-plan-to-shelter-and-house-62000/">Mayor Bruce Harrell</a> and homeless service providers, and focused on the 10,000-foot view while neglecting ground-level basics, like opening <a href="https://publicola.com/2023/01/31/homeless-authority-struggles-to-find-severe-weather-shelter-providers-after-key-contractor-bows-out/">severe weather shelters</a> and <a href="https://publicola.com/2023/05/11/homeless-service-providers-many-unpaid-since-last-year-demand-reforms/">paying homeless services providers on time.</a></p>
<p>Under Dones&#8217; leadership, the KCRHA established a clear picture of the homelessness problem in King County—tens of thousands of people are living unsheltered, in vehicles, and in emergency housing such as hotels and congregate shelters—and housing or even sheltering them all is a problem with a price tag of billions of dollars a year.</p>
<p>But the agency also fell behind schedule on many of its initial goals, including relatively short-term commitments like the plan, announced with great fanfare in February 2022, to end unsheltered homelessness in downtown Seattle <a href="https://publicola.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Embargoed-Partnership-for-Zero-Reporter-Briefing-1.pdf">in &#8220;as little as 12 months</a>&#8221; through a public-private partnership with the corporate-backed nonprofit agency We Are In. Although efforts to respond to homelessness continue downtown—including escalated sweeps by the city of Seattle, combined with more thoughtful one-off projects like the <a href="https://crosscut.com/news/2023/02/seattles-third-avenue-project-takes-new-approach-old-problems">Third Avenue Project</a>—unsheltered homelessness remains a pervasive issue in the area.</p>

<p>The plan, known as <a href="https://publicola.com/2022/02/17/private-donations-will-fund-peer-navigators-launch-plan-to-dramatically-reduce-downtown-homelessness/">Partnership for Zero</a>, was for the KCRHA to use private donations to hire <a href="https://publicola.com/2022/02/11/homelessness-authority-to-announce-one-time-philanthropic-funding-for-downtown-seattle-priorities/">dozens of outreach workers</a> with &#8220;lived experience,&#8221; who would serve as a single point of contact for people living unsheltered downtown, navigating them &#8220;longitudinally&#8221; and directly from street homelessness into permanent housing, much of it provided by private landlords motivated by a desire to help solve the homelessness crisis. The coordinating body for this partnership is a &#8220;<a href="https://publicola.com/2022/11/14/housing-command-center-has-housed-4-so-far-councils-budget-could-shake-up-homeless-funding/">housing command center</a>&#8221; that meets daily to discuss clients&#8217; individual cases, with the goal of moving them into permanent housing that works for them.</p>
<p>From inception, there were a number of issues with this approach, chief among them the fact that Seattle—unlike, say, New Orleans and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/14/headway/houston-homeless-people.html">Houston</a>, two cities that have successfully moved people directly from the streets to housing—does not have an abundance of vacant apartments, much less housing low-income people can afford. (The Partnership for Zero plan assumes that, in many cases, people will begin paying full rent after a year or so of subsidy).</p>
<p>The plan also assumes that Medicaid will become the primary funding source for the partnership, an assumption many providers have called <a href="https://publicola.com/2023/04/24/marquee-plan-to-end-unsheltered-homelessness-depends-on-federal-funding-source-some-call-risky/">premature</a>, given the difficulties existing agencies face securing Medicaid reimbursement even for services that are traditionally covered by the federal program.</p>
<p>By setting up a in-house outreach program that duplicated work the agency&#8217;s own nonprofit outreach contractors have been providing for years, the KCRHA also created an unequal system in which government employees receive substantially higher pay, and access to more housing resources, than existing outreach providers. This two-track system has understandably irked some nonprofit outreach agencies, who have protested that setting up a parallel system puts them at a disadvantage when it comes to helping clients and retaining qualified staff, who can earn far more money doing the same job for the KCRHA.</p>

<p>More importantly, the partnership<a href="https://publicola.com/2023/02/21/plan-to-eliminate-visible-homelessness-downtown-is-clearly-behind-schedule-but-backers-remain-optimistic/"> hasn&#8217;t produced the results it promised</a>, putting about 200 people so far on a &#8220;path&#8221; toward housing, according to the KCRHA—one reason agency leaders could sunset the program in the post-Dones era.</p>
<p>One criticism of the KCRHA, under Dones&#8217; leadership, is that Dones&#8217; big-picture proposals have sometimes been at odds with political and practical realities. For example, the agency&#8217;s <a href="https://publicola.com/2023/02/15/ambitious-new-plan-says-king-county-needs-to-spend-billions-a-year-on-homelessness-but-is-that-realistic-or-even-necessary/">initial five-year plan</a>—widely, if somewhat unfairly, criticized for being a &#8220;$12 billion plan to end homelessness&#8221;—included a number of unforced errors, beyond its eye-popping price tag.</p>
<p>Under the <a href="https://kcrha.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/a.-interlocal-agreement-for-the-establishment-of-the-king-county-regional-homelessness-authority-between-king-county-and-the-city-of-seattle-pursuant-to-rcw-39.34-2.pdf">agreement</a> that established the KCRHA, the five-year plan was supposed to set out practical goals for the first five years of agency operations, with the goal of reducing homelessness among specific population groups. Instead, the initial version of the plan laid out what it would cost, in theory, to eliminate unsheltered homelessness in five years. (The plan does not deal directly with housing, which is the responsibility of other agencies, like the city of Seattle&#8217;s Office of Housing.) The plan proposed spending billions of dollars a year on shelter, along with thousands of new &#8220;safe parking&#8221; spaces for people living in their vehicles—an utterly impractical proposal, given the region&#8217;s inability to site even one permanent safe lot in more than a decade of efforts to do so.</p>
<p>The initial five-year plan also called for reducing funding for <a href="https://publicola.com/2023/02/20/oversight-board-questions-price-tag-exclusion-of-tiny-houses-from-homeless-agencys-five-year-plan/">tiny house villages</a>, singling out this shelter type (along with the region&#8217;s tiny house village provider, the Low Income Housing Institute) as undesirable despite the fact that the city of Seattle, the KCRHA&#8217;s chief funder, prefers to fund tiny houses over almost every other form of shelter. Defending the proposal to cut funding for tiny houses while investing billions in other forms of shelter and parking lots for people to live in their cars, Dones said it was &#8220;just math,&#8221; pointing to a survey the agency conducted of about 180 homeless people that was used to determine the mix of services in the plan.</p>
<p>The proposal antagonized other existing shelter providers, too, by asserting that almost one in four shelter beds are vacant (and, by implication, useless). And it set off alarms among suburban city leaders because it called for the complete elimination of funding for congregate shelters—the only form of shelter that exists in many cities outside Seattle.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the agency adopted a <a href="https://kcrha.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Revised-Five-Year-Plan-5.12.pdf">rewritten plan</a> that omitted most of the prescriptive language from the initial proposal, along with language criticizing the purported failures of the existing shelter system. While the original proposal included seven goals and dozens of sub-strategies, the plan adopted by the agency&#8217;s boards earlier this month focuses on &#8220;one goal&#8221;: Reducing unsheltered homelessness and preventing homeless people from dying. More than 30 pages lighter than the original proposal, the new five-year plan meets the bare minimum requirements of the KCRHA&#8217;s charter while allowing plenty of room for future leaders to pick their own priorities. <a href="https://publicola.com/2023/05/30/with-the-departure-of-founding-ceo-dones-what-comes-next-for-the-regions-homelessness-agency/#more-32913" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">&#8220;With the Departure of Founding CEO Dones, What Comes Next for the Region&#8217;s Homelessness Agency?&#8221;</span> <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

<p><em><strong>By Erica C. Barnett</strong></em></p>
<p>An encampment on property owned by the city of Burien could be swept as soon as this week, after a nonprofit animal shelter run by the director of Discover Burien, a local business group, secured the right to <a href="https://www.burienwa.gov/city_hall/working_with_us/bids_rfp_rfq/lease_of_city-owned_property">lease the property</a> from the city starting on June 1, and—according to Burien City Manager <a href="https://b-townblog.com/burien-city-manager-responds-to-king-countys-letter-warning-that-police-wont-help-with-encampment-sweep/">Adolfo Bailon</a>—evict the people living there. The shelter, Burien CARES, has said it plans to &#8220;revert&#8221; the property, which had been an informal dog park, &#8220;back to its most recent use by the community as a dog recreation and relief area.&#8221;</p>
<p>The encampment was originally located next to City Hall and the downtown Burien branch of the King County Library system, but was booted earlier this year after the condo association that owns the property, whose sole members are the library and the city, voted to make the area around the building a &#8220;no-camping&#8221; zone. Encampments are also banned in all city parks, limiting where people can legally sleep to bits of city-owned property like the one Burien CARES now plans to lease.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the city had taken the responsibility and said, &#8216;here’s a spot for the people living at City Hall,&#8217; and put up some boundaries, [the encampment] probably wouldn’t have grown,&#8221; said Nancy Kick, a Burien resident and activist who opposes sweeping the encampment. &#8220;This was all foreseeable; if you don’t create a solution, then the solution creates itself. It’s going to just be what it is and you can’t control it at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although local advocates and outreach groups have asked King County and the King County Regional Homelessness Authority to help secure housing or shelter for the dozens of people who will be forced to move their tents elsewhere in Burien if the sweep takes place, those efforts have been unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, KCRHA director Anne Martens told PubliCola agency staffers have been meeting with outreach, shelter, and advocacy groups, as well as the city of Burien, and &#8220;continue to work together to seek housing and shelter placements.&#8221; However, as of last week, those talks hadn&#8217;t resulted in a solution for the dozens of people who stand to be evicted from the site this week.</p>
<p>Last week, King County Executive Dow Constantine informed the city of Burien that the county sheriff&#8217;s department, which provides Burien&#8217;s police force, would not help Burien CARES or city officials remove encampment residents from the property.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although the City currently owns the City Lot, it has not identified housing alternatives for the persons who live there despite constitutional duties imposed on the City under federal law,&#8221; <a href="https://publicola.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Burien-Public-Camping-Letter-5-22-2023.pdf">the letter</a>, signed by Constantine&#8217;s general counsel, David Hackett, says. &#8220;Instead, the City is attempting to circumvent those duties by entering a lease with a private party, who will maintain and continue the use of the City Lot as a public dog park while attempting to use criminal trespass to force unhoused persons from the premises.&#8221;</p>
<div class="perfect-pullquote vcard pullquote-align-full pullquote-border-placement-left"><blockquote><p>Meanwhile, the Burien City City Council has scheduled a special meeting for Tuesday, May 30 to discuss—among other combatively worded agenda items—&#8221;the best response to the fact that Burien is one of the few, if not the only, jurisdiction other than Seattle to welcome a DESC facility, and yet King County refuses to help Burien help the unhoused&#8221; and &#8220;the value of the contract for King County Sheriff’s Office services since the Sheriff’s Office refuses to provide police services.&#8221;</p></blockquote></div>
<p>Under a 2019 federal circuit court ruling called <em>Martin v. Boise</em>, governments can&#8217;t force people to move from public property if there is no suitable shelter available. Burien&#8217;s approach of leasing out its land and having its tenant evict encampment residents represents an attempt to &#8220;evade the holding in Martin,&#8221; Hackett wrote, because the land is still city property—and the city hasn&#8217;t offered the homeless people living there anywhere else to go.</p>
<p>Burien disagrees with this, <a href="https://burienwa.civicweb.net/document/84840/Next%20Steps%20in%20Response%20to%20King%20County%20Letter,%20D.pdf?handle=AA8A046FDABC40DD9509288D8DCA0DEB">arguing</a> that the city doesn&#8217;t have an ordinance banning people from sleeping on city property in general, just parks, and that the city is &#8220;not asking for or seeking criminal penalties, fines, or even arrests&#8221; for the people it wants the sheriff&#8217;s department to assist in removing from its property.</p>
<p>Gallagher, a spokesman for Constantine, said the county has &#8220;continuously engaged with the City of Burien throughout the past few months to help the city identify a solution that meets the needs of our shared residents. Homelessness is a regional problem, and every jurisdiction plays a part in finding solutions. But that regional aspect doesn’t alleviate cities from the responsibility of serving their residents and taking action directly in their community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last year the Burien City Council approved a new Downtown Emergency Service Center project that will provide 95 units of permanent supportive housing, with 30 percent of the units reserved for Burien residents. However, that building won&#8217;t come online until next year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Burien City City Council has scheduled a special meeting for Tuesday, May 30 to discuss—among other combatively worded agenda items—&#8221;the best response to the fact that Burien is one of the few, if not the only, jurisdiction other than Seattle to welcome a DESC facility, and yet King County refuses to help Burien help the unhoused&#8221; and &#8220;the value of the contract for King County Sheriff’s Office services since the Sheriff’s Office refuses to provide police services.&#8221;</p>

<p><em><strong>By Erica C. Barnett</strong></em></p>
<p>But City Attorney Ann Davison informed the Seattle Municipal Court today that the city of Seattle will no longer participate in the municipal court&#8217;s pioneering community court—a therapeutic court that allows people accused of certain low-level crimes to access services without pleading guilty to a crime. The decision effectively represents the end of community court in Seattle.</p>
<p>&#8220;After considerable thought and discussion,&#8221; Criminal Division Director Natalie Walton-Anderson wrote in <a href="https://publicola.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/CAO-Community-Court-Termination-Letter-05-26-23.pdf">a letter</a> to municipal court judges Friday afternoon, &#8220;the City Attorney has decided to end the criminal division’s participation in Community Court. We recognize that Community Court has been part of the Seattle Municipal Court’s practice for many years, and that many will be disappointed by this decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, I want to assure you that the City Attorney remains committed to the principles behind the original formation of Community Court, and we remain committed to working with court and the Department of Public Defense to mitigate the potential impacts of this decision and to work together to find innovative and effective ways to address the criminal justice issues in our city.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Judge Damon Shadid, who established and oversaw community court, Davison&#8217;s office &#8220;never negotiated in good faith regarding the changes they wanted in community court. They came with demands and if their demands weren’t met exactly, they continually threatened to pull out of the court.&#8221; Shadid spoke to PubliCola in his personal capacity, not in his role as a judge</p>
<p>In a statement, King County Department of Public Defense director Anita Khandelwal expressed dismay at Davison&#8217;s unilateral decision to pull out of community court.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are in the midst of a public health crisis. Our community members are dying from drug overdoses and need access to housing and to community-based services,&#8221; Khandelwal said. &#8220;Evidence demonstrates that the criminal legal system does not change behavior and that it undermines public safety by destabilizing people&#8217;s lives. Community Court was a collaborative effort to reduce the harm of the system and instead connect people charged with nonviolent misdemeanor offenses to services. Nonetheless, the Seattle City Attorney &#8230; seeks to push people deeper into a criminal legal carceral system that is expensive, deadly, and deeply racially disproportionate.&#8221;</p>
<p>One issue that came up during internal deliberations over the future of community court was whether defendants should have to do community service as a condition of receiving services through the court. During the pandemic, the court allowed people to take a life skills class in lieu of in-person community service, an option Shadid said proved to be more effective at helping people achieve their goals than requiring them to do manual labor near the courthouse. In her letter, Walton-Anderson said the work requirement was &#8220;a central component&#8221; of the original community court plan—one that would have had to be restored for the court to continue.</p>
<div class="perfect-pullquote vcard pullquote-align-full pullquote-border-placement-left"><blockquote><p>&#8220;The city attorney&#8217;s office would accept absolutely no compromise when it came to community service, regardless of the information that was provided to them about the efficacy of community service in the courts or just whether or not its right or wrong to force someone to work in order to receive services.&#8221;—Seattle Municipal Court Judge Damon Shadid</p></blockquote></div>
<p>In recent months, Shadid said, the city attorney&#8217;s main demand was that the court require its participants to complete at least six hours of community service. However, he said, &#8220;the city attorney&#8217;s office would accept absolutely no compromise when it came to community service, regardless of the information that was provided to them about the efficacy of community service in the courts or just whether or not its right or wrong to force someone to work in order to receive services.&#8221;</p>
<p>Davison&#8217;s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the decision to pull out of community court. In her letter, Walton-Anderson said the city attorney&#8217;s office will &#8220;shift cases where the defendant is likely to engage with service providers to a pre-filing diversion model.&#8221; The letter does not provide any details about this model or how the city attorney will determine which people are &#8220;likely to engage with service providers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Community court is a therapeutic, rather than punitive, court aimed at people who commit low-level crimes like theft, trespassing, and resisting arrest; people who commit serious misdemeanors, like DUI and domestic violence, are not eligible. Its goal is to address the root causes of people&#8217;s criminal activity, such as addiction and homelessness, by enrolling people in case management and services as an alternative to prosecution and jail.</p>
<p>Last year, Davison <a href="https://publicola.com/2022/04/27/city-attorney-davison-asks-court-to-let-her-deny-high-utilizers-access-to-community-court/">successfully pushed the court</a> to categorically exclude people on her &#8220;high utilizers&#8221; list—those accused of more than 12 misdemeanor offenses in the past five years—from community court, arguing that people who commit crimes repeatedly &#8220;need meaningful accountability&#8221; in the form of prosecution and jail.</p>
<p>The court became an issue in last year&#8217;s municipal court elections. Davison-aligned candidates (including one of her own employees, assistant city attorney <a href="https://publicola.com/2022/10/27/publicola-questions-nyjat-rose-akins/">Nyjat Rose-Akins</a>, running against incumbent, and community court champion, <a href="https://publicola.com/2022/10/28/publicola-questions-damon-shadid/">Damon Shadid</a>) argued for drastically changing or eliminating community court on the grounds that it was all carrot, no stick. Rose-Akins, along with incumbent Adam Eisenberg, lost to their more progressive opponents, extinguishing conservative hopes that a new court would make community court more punitive or eliminate it altogether.</p>

<p>In the letter to judges, which refers to community court as &#8220;Community Court 3.0&#8221; because it is the court&#8217;s third iteration, Walton-Anderson said the current court has not produced results, pointing to the fact that many people fail to appear in court for their first appearances—a point Rose-Akins made repeatedly in her campaign against Shadid last year. Shadid counters that the failure to appear rate for first appearances is &#8220;extraordinarily high&#8221; for misdemeanor cases throughout the municipal court system; &#8220;the only difference now is that in community court, we could try to connect people to services the day they came into court instead of warehousing them in the jail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like many documents from Davison&#8217;s office, the letter uses several extreme, cherry-picked anecdotes about community court participants who went on to commit serious crimes to suggest community court is a soft-on-crime failure, including one involving a five-year-old child.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Davison supported legislation sponsored by Councilmember Sara Nelson that will, if it passes, empower her office to prosecute people for possessing small amounts of drugs and using drugs in public, a first in the city&#8217;s history. (The Nelson bill stems from recent state action to make drug possession a gross misdemeanor. For Seattle to prosecute drug users under the new state law, the city has to pass a local law that incorporates—or goes beyond—the state law, which is what the proposed new law would do.)</p>
<p>According to some estimates, the new anti-drug law could result in up to 800 additional prosecutions per year—cases that, because they&#8217;ll be in mainstream court, will require full discovery, adding to existing court delays and further increasing the population of the downtown jail, which is currently sending inmates to jails in South King County in response to dangerous understaffing.</p>

<p><em><strong>B</strong></em><em><strong>y Erica C. Barnett</strong></em></p>
<p>Earlier this week, the Seattle City Council finally adopted a set of restrictive new rules making it harder and more expensive for property owners to remove trees in their private lawns by more than tripling the number of regulated trees in the city.</p>
<p>The rules, which govern removal of any tree larger than six inches in diameter, go further than any previous ordinance, requiring land owners to replace any tree larger than 12 inches in diameter or pay a “payment in lieu” of replacement that ranges from $2,833 to tens of thousands of dollars. They are, in a word, <a href="https://publicola.com/2023/04/11/byzantine-tree-regulations-wont-save-seattles-urban-forest/">Byzantine—</a>and do nothing to address tree loss in the city&#8217;s own parks and open spaces, which are losing a greater proportion of their trees than privately owned property.</p>
<p>Which made it all the more remarkable when, at Tuesday&#8217;s meeting, &#8220;tree protection&#8221; advocates—in many cases, people who use &#8220;save the trees&#8221; as a proxy for anti-housing, anti-renter sentiments—argued that the council should scrap the whole policy in favor of a brand-new proposal floated by Councilemember Alex Pedersen that would vastly restrict development on nearly all the city&#8217;s low-density residential land. During public comment, speaker after speaker lined up to argue that the restrictive new tree ordinance would empower developers to &#8220;cover 85 percent of detached residential lots with structures,&#8221; as one commenter put it—a misinterpretation, encouraged by Pedersen, of regulations that do no such thing.</p>
<div class="perfect-pullquote vcard pullquote-align-full pullquote-border-placement-left"><blockquote><p>Pedersen did nothing to dispel his supporters&#8217; misinterpretation of the law on Tuesday. Instead, he argued that the council &#8220;should vote [the legislation] down and start over&#8221;—presumably with <a href="https://publicola.com/2023/05/08/pedersen-fails-to-stifle-housing-development-in-the-guise-of-tree-protection/">his own proposal</a>, rejected overwhelmingly earlier this month, that would have made it difficult to build anything other than single-family houses in areas where low-density multifamily housing, such as duplexes, was recently legalized.</p></blockquote></div>
<p>The misconception stems from the fact that the new bill limits the amount of &#8220;developable&#8221; land on any residential lot to a maximum of 85 percent, once all tree protection requirements are factored in. In a maximal development scenario, in which tree protection areas only make up 15 percent of a lot, it would still be impossible to turn the rest of the lot into buildings. That&#8217;s because the city also has many other ordinances in place requiring walkways, landscaping, parking, green plantings, and other mandatory amenities. Altogether, these mandatory amenities restrict housing development to between 30 and 45 percent of any residential lot.</p>

<p>Pedersen did nothing to dispel his supporters&#8217; inaccurate interpretation of the law on Tuesday. Instead, he argued that the council &#8220;should vote [the legislation] down and start over&#8221;—presumably with <a href="https://publicola.com/2023/05/08/pedersen-fails-to-stifle-housing-development-in-the-guise-of-tree-protection/">his own proposal</a>, rejected overwhelmingly earlier this month, that would have made it difficult to build anything other than single-family houses in areas where low-density multifamily housing, such as duplexes, was recently legalized.</p>
<p>Quoting at length from the Seattle Times editorial board&#8217;s <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/editorials/seattles-proposed-tree-ordinance-is-the-legislative-equivalent-of-a-chain-saw/">error-riddled argument</a> against the legislation, which also repeated the inaccurate claim that &#8220;developers would be able to build on 85% of the lot in low-rise and other zones,&#8221; Pedersen said, &#8220;The process produced a pro-developer tree removal measure instead of one that actually preserves and grows trees. If this bill passes, there will be less shade and higher street level temperatures. That&#8217;s from the Seattle Times editorial board and I concur with those comments.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tree ordinance passed 6-1, with Pedersen voting &#8220;no&#8221;; Councilmembers Debora Juarez and Kshama Sawant were absent.</p>

			<p>My computer is the single most important piece of equipment I own, and for much of the last five years, I&#8217;ve relied on my trusty 2015 MacBook Pro to write and edit posts, tweet up a storm from public meetings, file public records requests, edit transcripts and photos, and generally keep The C Is for Crank in operation. Now it&#8217;s time to retire my old machine and trade it in for a newer model.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d really appreciate any help my readers are willing to provide to help me defray the cost of this critical piece of office equipment. A new, faster machine (not to mention one without—ahem—an ever-so-<em>slightly</em> cracked screen) will make it easier to bring The C Is for Crank to you every day. My back will also be grateful as I rush from candidate debate to city council meeting to coffee shop back to City Hall.
