It seems the city gets hotter each day. Even the breeze that comes from the sea is hot. That doesn't help at all. Studying with your instrument might get sticky from time to time if you sweat a lot. One of the must important things to consider is the humidity of the environment. The other is how the contraction and expansion of wood affects the strings.\n\nTruth be told, I have not broken a lot of strings while playing. I used to have the money to change them when needed. That's back when I started playing mandolin. With the Venezuelan Cuatro, this has been even better. These strings don't break that much unless you're playing everyday of the week like a madman. I'm one but I do other stuff. However, the times when it has happened had been when I tried different tunings and strings order.\n\nToday, as I was preparing to record my cover for the week, this happed:\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n![IMG_20230605_160621.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/bertrayo/EpLfUXNY5QyWhBNUf4i7Xegp8XxjpDLSENcQsUXVnEjJiqtVa6igihSMsQ3LH4EGCYV.jpg)\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n![IMG_20230605_160708.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/bertrayo/Ep1XwwtQcpNZF82fXTKiLWkurynBQDfwn9HKs5JpHYAbTncMPhWJx9ZFHvpPXE2QaKv.jpg)\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\nSure, it was just one string. But it's the most important string for the style I play as it is the treble of the instrument. The worst part was not having a single replacement. I guess that saying about a smith having a wooden knife at home makes a lot of sense now. I only have complete sets of strings. And changing them would mean having to wait to record until the new set stretches out and holds the tuning.\n\nAt first, I was kind of mad at this. I blame it on the weather since it's hot outside and I can't be moving the instrument from the AC in my room to the hot living all the time. That's bad for the wood! But the strings had been on the Cuatro for quite some months now. So, I guess it was time for a change.\n\nSo, I stopped what I was doing.\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt;No recording taking place today.\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\nAnd I set my sights into the act of changing the strings. Not having a set of the same I had before meant I needed to see if the ones I available where of my liking. Both are very different in sound, but since my instrument has a bright sound, I decided to go with strings that boost that sound.\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n![IMG_20230605_162509.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/bertrayo/EokedxpLv6VY72u6RqqzoarbjNEiG2V3k8AyfWvki2NZhMb14TRZii7xzkwkuFYAmon.jpg)\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n![IMG_20230605_162950.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/bertrayo/EoAaoDmmFWy4EhzGCtgozDC7muM3gA2qELmu9Q8uEz6mGE37BYdoTsUDMr4bEM9pvZR.jpg)\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n![IMG_20230605_163047.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/bertrayo/Eopvn27t3i7tzSB4UWH3YG2bptuBa9xDay9pEYXxvEvksZzTirVoXtqEXbJTywq4Ajw.jpg)\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n![IMG_20230605_163043.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/bertrayo/23wWw7UapYuwAZLv5WenDjGdTmQxfDcH6XnvmcGheHbK6niCREhcTrJ315xGz2qJFU2yh.jpg)\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n![IMG_20230605_163655.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/bertrayo/EoyQw8MJyyJgp2zfjHC3u83sopd6wADwjr9AWZg3yyiWrpDUjFE8ECQF8jxd61jjduS.jpg)\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n![IMG_20230605_164048.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/bertrayo/241tV6h3PVqQAyuCkbJhd1DsTv9X2C2aiMGS6e4g6VwWQnFt88VYEEG1ztBMpG5nkKpR6.jpg)\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n![IMG_20230605_163811.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/bertrayo/23xp8dks8bJYxApZcGCmiWAitpxRhSFHnsuXAVDvW4rPBWNW1BZAHPvRnxsJjxw7zAaY2.jpg)\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\nIt was an ordeal to do this outside. The weather made it worse. But as I was complaining about this. The gentle breeze that brings water came by. I heard the wind chime making the sounds that usually get in my recordings. And for a moment, I didn't feel like melting.\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n\nhttps://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/bertrayo/EpA2ychFyRF4q6DzEQ9NwSWXE3YaFfYuLwvzTnxbQC4U7ScLWuXSRdGXhiiPqR9yH44.jpg\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n\nThere goes Embla with a new set of strings. This is one of the less glamorous parts of being a musician, but hey at least these ones I can change. It isn't like this is a piano and I need to call some trained professional to do it.\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt;Just poking fun at @mipiano. But I don't know if she knows how to change a piano string.\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\nAnd now that this minor issue has been solved, it's time to play a lot to get those strings in shape for the solos and the fast rhythms of Venezuelan music and everything else. I think that changing the strings, regardless of having one broken or not, is one of the most intimate moments a musician share with their instrument. It's certainly one that is very close to the construction process. I have installed sets of strings a lot of times. Even more now that I make the instruments myself. But there's something magical about. It feels like a kind of parental relationship. Your child is hurt or sick and you do something that magically makes everything better. It might be a stretch to put it that way, but those who have changed a string even once in their life will related to the feeling.\n\nLike an injury or disease, the healing process isn't something that happens in one second. That's the same with the strings needing time to stretch and being ready to play without loosing their pitch.\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt;Maybe I'm just a helpless romantic idealizing the act of changing strings... But who could tell?\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n\nhttps://images.hive.blog/0x0/https://images.hive.blog/DQmPTLhVNyDnLA1pK3vUcmhgCVCDtvqDiE2TE95zU7V5w5Y/hive%20dividers-11.png\n\n- &lt;sub&gt;Photos📷: @bertrayo (Redmi Note 8)&lt;/sub&gt;\n\n\n- &lt;sub&gt;Editing 🎬: @bertrayo, made Adobe Photoshop Lightroom.&lt;/sub&gt;\n\nhttps://images.hive.blog/0x0/https://images.hive.blog/DQmPTLhVNyDnLA1pK3vUcmhgCVCDtvqDiE2TE95zU7V5w5Y/hive%20dividers-11.png\n\n![Logo grabado en madera.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/bertrayo/23zSQj2AJbb1sDFYr5A14SXTNDhWwhL7uLaEGV5RehyvGfeaVj6PRdeut8GrNDdfNswqD.jpg)\n\n&lt;em&gt;Follow me on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/luthier_andresalvarez?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=) for enquires and commission.\n\nIf you'd like to help the workshop grow, you can make a donation [here](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/LuthierAndres).\n\nYou can find me at discord as bertrayo#1763&lt;/em&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;","community_title":"Q Inspired-by-Music","max_accepted_payout":"1000000.000 HBD","beneficiaries":[],"depth":0,"promoted":"0.000 HBD","author_title":"","net_rshares":98187446701287,"json_metadata":{"app":"peakd/2023.6.2","format":"markdown","tags":["story","music","strings","instrument","luthier","diy","life"],"users":["mipiano.","bertrayo"],"image":["https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/bertrayo/Ep1XwwtQcpNZF82fXTKiLWkurynBQDfwn9HKs5JpHYAbTncMPhWJx9ZFHvpPXE2QaKv.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/bertrayo/EpLfUXNY5QyWhBNUf4i7Xegp8XxjpDLSENcQsUXVnEjJiqtVa6igihSMsQ3LH4EGCYV.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/bertrayo/EokedxpLv6VY72u6RqqzoarbjNEiG2V3k8AyfWvki2NZhMb14TRZii7xzkwkuFYAmon.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/bertrayo/EoAaoDmmFWy4EhzGCtgozDC7muM3gA2qELmu9Q8uEz6mGE37BYdoTsUDMr4bEM9pvZR.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/bertrayo/Eopvn27t3i7tzSB4UWH3YG2bptuBa9xDay9pEYXxvEvksZzTirVoXtqEXbJTywq4Ajw.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/bertrayo/23wWw7UapYuwAZLv5WenDjGdTmQxfDcH6XnvmcGheHbK6niCREhcTrJ315xGz2qJFU2yh.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/bertrayo/EoyQw8MJyyJgp2zfjHC3u83sopd6wADwjr9AWZg3yyiWrpDUjFE8ECQF8jxd61jjduS.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/bertrayo/241tV6h3PVqQAyuCkbJhd1DsTv9X2C2aiMGS6e4g6VwWQnFt88VYEEG1ztBMpG5nkKpR6.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/bertrayo/23xp8dks8bJYxApZcGCmiWAitpxRhSFHnsuXAVDvW4rPBWNW1BZAHPvRnxsJjxw7zAaY2.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/bertrayo/EpA2ychFyRF4q6DzEQ9NwSWXE3YaFfYuLwvzTnxbQC4U7ScLWuXSRdGXhiiPqR9yH44.jpg","https://images.hive.blog/DQmPTLhVNyDnLA1pK3vUcmhgCVCDtvqDiE2TE95zU7V5w5Y/hive%20dividers-11.png","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/bertrayo/23zSQj2AJbb1sDFYr5A14SXTNDhWwhL7uLaEGV5RehyvGfeaVj6PRdeut8GrNDdfNswqD.jpg"]},"payout":46.106,"replies":[],"created":"2023-06-06T12:30:00","community":"hive-192806","author_role":"guest","permlink":"broken-string","author":"bertrayo","payout_at":"2023-06-13T12:30:00","author_payout_value":"0.000 HBD","is_paidout":false,"author_reputation":74.37,"url":"/hive-192806/@bertrayo/broken-string","active_votes":null,"percent_hbd":10000,"blacklists":[],"title":"Broken String!","post_id":124206535,"updated":"2023-06-06T12:30:00","category":"hive-192806","stats":{"hide":false,"gray":false,"total_votes":610,"flag_weight":0},"children":21},"jasperdick/tcpbghef":{"pending_payout_value":"50.839 HBD","curator_payout_value":"0.000 HBD","body":"&lt;center&gt;\n\n[![](https://ipfs-3speak.b-cdn.net/ipfs/bafybeihonptlmaac56lqvccwlh4nldizqwb6baf3dugjbsdr7qussmm4ly/)](https://3speak.tv/watch?v=jasperdick/tcpbghef)\n\n▶️ [Watch on 3Speak](https://3speak.tv/watch?v=jasperdick/tcpbghef)\n\n&lt;/center&gt;\n\n---\n\nHello everybody on HIVE, and especially the Music Community. My name is Jasper and I'm writing (and singing) to you from Cape Town in South Africa!\r\n\r\nThis is my 41st week (In a row!) contributing to \"Three Tune Tuesday\", an initiative started by @ablaze. It is week 106 overall!\r\n\r\nIn all of my TTT entries I like to play the songs on guitar as well as share the original videos... and I have a newish pattern for \"Three Tune Tuesday\" where I pick three songs by one of my favourite artists, that has inspired me - as I also write original songs.\r\n\r\nThis week I would like to pick the rather challenging Sting & The Police.  Their most famous song is \"Every Breathe You Take (I'll Be Watching You)\", but that song is very dependent on its beautiful bassline to sound good, so I'm going to try three other ones!  It has also always sounded quite creepy (stalkerish) to me!\r\n\r\nThe first is \"Every Little Thing She Does is Magic\" - the chord structure of the bridge is all over the place but I think I'm getting it now!   Hahaha!  Here is the original version:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aENX1Sf3fgQ\r\n\r\nFor the second song, I just love the chord structure and changes of \"Message in a Bottle\" - I chord just play the verse all day!  Hahaha!  Here is the original version:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbXWrmQW-OE \r\n\r\nI also love a version that John Mayer did quite early in his career at a concert in his hometown of Birmingham, Alabama - \r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CLtXQFmk28\r\n\r\nFinally, please excuse me as I tinker with the tuning of my guitar (rather inefficiently) as I have found that I like to play my final Police song of the day in DADGAD tuning.  It is called \"King of Pain\"!  Here is the original:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZlRX03BzeA \r\n\r\nI also think that an Alanis Morrisette cover of this song, during her unplugged MTV performance, is fantastic:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoOgHi17sp8\r\n\r\nSo that's week 106 done and dusted! I hope you enjoyed the Sting & The Police songs! Which song was your favourite? Did I miss an important one to you?  (Yes, yes - \"Every Breath You Take\" is an obvious one!)\r\n\r\nAnd so, which artist will I do three covers of next week, for TTT number 107? I hope you tune in to find out and thank you so much for clicking/watching/reading this time!!\n\n---\n\n▶️ [3Speak](https://3speak.tv/watch?v=jasperdick/tcpbghef)\n","community_title":"Music","max_accepted_payout":"100000.000 HBD","beneficiaries":[{"account":"eastspk","weight":100},{"account":"spk.beneficiary","weight":900},{"account":"threespeakleader","weight":100}],"depth":0,"promoted":"0.000 HBD","author_title":"verified","net_rshares":108215002352057,"json_metadata":{"tags":["ttt","threetunetuesday","gems","ocd","palnet","neoxian","pob","proofofbrain","3speak","appreciator","busybees","cover","sting","thepolice","everylittlethingshedoesismagic","messageinabottle","kingofpain","acoustic","guitar","capetown","southafrica"],"app":"3speak/0.3.0","type":"3speak/video","image":["https://ipfs-3speak.b-cdn.net/ipfs/bafybeihonptlmaac56lqvccwlh4nldizqwb6baf3dugjbsdr7qussmm4ly"],"video":{"info":{"video_v2":"ipfs://QmUfgibr4dn87X5RujS47Us1ANaoVSCkFkHZiQpYXneCKe/manifest.m3u8","sourceMap":[{"type":"video","url":"ipfs://QmUfgibr4dn87X5RujS47Us1ANaoVSCkFkHZiQpYXneCKe/manifest.m3u8","format":"m3u8"},{"type":"thumbnail","url":"ipfs://bafybeihonptlmaac56lqvccwlh4nldizqwb6baf3dugjbsdr7qussmm4ly"}],"permlink":"tcpbghef","author":"jasperdick","lang":"en","firstUpload":false,"platform":"3speak","ipfs":null,"duration":893.436208,"title":"MUSIC: Three Tune Tuesday 106 - 3 Songs by Sting & The Police! - (3 Cover Performances!)","ipfsThumbnail":null,"file":"ipfs://bafybeig7sxsbotxfgg6ngflr737tn4yrsvq4v5wbr4yxxm3zesoo3wshim","filesize":800175824},"content":{"description":"Hello everybody on HIVE, and especially the Music Community.

Here is the original version:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbXWrmQW-OE \r\n\r\nI also love a version that John Mayer did quite early in his career at a concert in his hometown of Birmingham, Alabama - \r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CLtXQFmk28\r\n\r\nFinally, please excuse me as I tinker with the tuning of my guitar (rather inefficiently) as I have found that I like to play my final Police song of the day in DADGAD tuning.  It is called \"King of Pain\"!  Here is the original:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZlRX03BzeA \r\n\r\nI also think that an Alanis Morrisette cover of this song, during her unplugged MTV performance, is fantastic:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoOgHi17sp8\r\n\r\nSo that's week 106 done and dusted! I hope you enjoyed the Sting & The Police songs! Which song was your favourite? Did I miss an important one to you?  (Yes, yes - \"Every Breath You Take\" is an obvious one!)\r\n\r\nAnd so, which artist will I do three covers of next week, for TTT number 107?

As I have never been to this area, I wanted know little more this place. As I have always visited either the Šumava or the Bohemian Forest. The Všerubská vrchovina is a natural link between these two mountain ranges.\n\n*V posledním článku jsme se podívali na rally, ale tím víkend v oblasti Všerubské vrchoviny neskončil. Jelikož jsem v této oblasti nikdy nebyl, protože jsem vždy navštěvoval buď Šumavu, nebo Český les. Všerubská vrchovina je přirozená spojnice těchto dvou pohoří.*\n\n![IMG_20230423_060336.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/softa/Eo45gHXSsm8yRbPzMfvwsdDMQ21aNDPcpJE3jce6nN9Tr6dgUECkCT2unfPyHw4jxm4.jpg)\n\nIn the morning I woke up traditionally early, packed up my sleeping things in the middle of the moss kingdom and set off for another adventure. Because I drained all the batteries in my DSLR the day before, so this whole day is captured on my mobile phone.\n\n*Ráno jsem se vzbudil tradičně brzy, zabalil svoje nocoviště uprostřed mechového království a vyrazil vstříc dalšímu dobrodružství. Protože jsem předchozí den, vybil všechny baterie do mé zrcadlovky tak je celý tento den focen na mobilní telefon.*\n\n![IMG_20230422_194306.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/softa/23tvaMv9BQmkJexwau3C7pntAHLejFu22KkruZAzAnk3DwNpZmhFz1YK1y34iz56hsYkf.jpg)\n\n![IMG_20230423_064227.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/softa/EnqSaemn1xGP2ZJTfGgbo6khbDnYZSrgAmo3FXymL3m5SF1y8qyjEu3z57bpnMhDGx2.jpg)\n\n![IMG_20230423_065817.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/softa/23ynUXDufriysbtfWpfpRuM7EBnHwN5yTbgTj3PbnShgfdjLBJY7PZxHNJ6hD1DwXfSvW.jpg)\n\n![IMG_20230423_070927.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/softa/EoeENbsoCYawsoN4hEbGwTbMufxEdNdMhraMDTrT47HszYLM6fo76mBVv9WByrMb9Jy.jpg)\n\nRoad led on former military roads with the occasional view of neighboring Germany. After about an hour and a half I reached the places from where I saw the village Všeruby after which this highland is named.\n\n*Po bývalých vojenských cestách s občasným výhledem do sousedního Německa jsem asi po hodině a půl došel do míst odkud jsem uviděl vesnici, podle které se tato vrchovina jmenuje.*\n\n![IMG_20230423_071313.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/softa/EqfGwdiKpfmbzn4YngyayDr4bWyxgmZX2QEmjssfLwpKHgnuWNBejRGY4xPZECvYFrC.jpg)\n\n![IMG_20230423_074326.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/softa/EnWK3VPpztGWZd3C9ptWwd7nWe7SHMDRYQmqtxd7dT9tgpdzW9zSSoFKBop8c2crqNi.jpg)\n\nNow, Všeruby is a small village with a few dozen houses, but in the past it was one of the main roads from Bavaria to Bohemia, because the place where the village is located is essentially a pass between two mountain ranges. The Czech writer Bozena Němcová also lived in the village for some time and that is why her monument is here.\n\n*Všeruby jsou dnes malá vesnice o pár desítkách domů, ale v minulosti to byla jedna z hlavních cest z Bavorska do Čech, protože místo kde vesnice leží je v podstatě průsmyk mezi dvěma pohořími. V obci nějakou dobu žila také česká spisovatelka Božena Němcová a proto je zde její památník.*\n\n![IMG_20230423_080751.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/softa/EqNFC6iAVuVEUX49e1mZb5tKdm4vbNJcvu2kMxaHYnA833rX1NRDvp771Y7TJSxXPK6.jpg)\n\n![IMG_20230423_081350.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/softa/245n7YFr94Ev7fJhx5SXny5xY7ytRb51P5pzottz4E9XrBGaLwNZeG4ec3dzyw6r1TuKH.jpg)\n\n![IMG_20230423_085423.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/softa/EoGx12CEmnXtzTyEMWDeGDMUMtxrwBGoMr4wLgYwr2TU5JsMyhC3YYoVgU8EnkYNurY.jpg)\n\n![IMG_20230423_085443.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/softa/23w2H5ToT2mjFAQHnXa3VjqveTGnizvoMBmCUP11qrZjYUwE4A6NqRLt3BqPC42YFQnZ7.jpg)\n\nBehind Všeruby, the landscape changes every moment, and the path I chose led for a while through meadows and then through forests again. I even saw a beaver dam here, or a deer when I took a short break.\n\n*Za Všeruby se krajina mění každou chvíli a mnou vybraná cesta vedla chvíli po loukách a poté zase lesy. Dokonce jsem zde viděl i bobří hráz, nebo srnce když jsem si dával krátkou pauzu.*\n\n![IMG_20230423_093918.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/softa/23ujiNdEgZRbo6h8uRiDy4iUo9yaB9GyAF3wjB8h8RCjB5SqASPPyQMTFDRh3aeoviPbm.jpg)\n\nShortly after the village of Mlýneček, I climbed a hill and could look back where I came from.\n\n*Kousek za obcí Mlýneček jsem vystoupal na kopec a  mohl se podívat zpět odkud jsem přišel.*\n\n![IMG_20230423_103628.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/softa/EoMEgjYmrrF1basJ55w7paKTWqhejhuNkYo98a85peSPonW87qKkrTJRfcVzm4DNKih.jpg)\n\nBut then the landscape changed drastically and once again I found myself in a landscape of dead trees.\n\n*Jenže pak se krajina drasticky změnila a opět jako vždy jsem se ocitl v krajině mrtvých stromů.* \n\n![IMG_20230423_103820.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/softa/23u62swpNLZCwkUbgARnNDp5sAmbenmq7PscMBPT4VRuRNYrTZvHM76kKDobLu98cM3hn.jpg)\n\n![IMG_20230423_103952.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/softa/Eqb1bGijH7otmZTYHqNAjsaoxnvnDHRpgR9d9cM2Bo9fUHzR2xphdHEV7iwmoZY4eEe.jpg)\n\n![IMG_20230423_104114.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/softa/Eqd91M9GRxHxryxsjoZxVdsNBpNvC2uWUPteAomHWKje9DQzf96R1wQh9wyDXetHX3u.jpg)\n\n![IMG_20230423_104841.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/softa/Ep1Vzn3MUbuFrnU2ZzpUbGP4zkwaAPAHrzwgLFainBupSqghqRQpkFqCRvKXFGHG1P1.jpg)\n\nDespite the huge tree markers, the views made me get lost. And so the peaceful path along the tourist signs turned into a struggle for survival in the fields of dead trees.\n\n*I přes obrovské značky na stromech jsem se díky výhledům ztratil. A tak se poklidná cesta po turistických značkách změnila v boj o přežití v polomech mrtvých stromů.*\n\n![IMG_20230423_105313.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/softa/EqDk4XHiQ29JBNJQtcnZ6hq234GqNDn1U2nqrMuEWjZmzWcPNrTrsQ8m3jTuamNA3Bq.jpg)\n\nFortunately, in the Czech Republic we have laws according to which such places must be reforested, which is evidently happening here. But again, not a completely well-chosen combination of trees.\n\n*Naštěstí máme v České republice zákony, podle kterých je třeba taková místa opět zalesnit, což se zde evidentně děje. Ale opět ne úplně dobře zvolenou kombinací stromů.*\n\n![IMG_20230423_111546.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/softa/EqDi9ZSALYY9tXb3P84vb3YXPxvJkxV4XGDPaueQbqSjNXNwPup73qgiUp66dgZRMN7.jpg)\n\n![IMG_20230423_113933.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/softa/Eou9DEBPkBrXE23xRhaCQ6LfAgKHPiW6J9gf5Q7F89AvDpU1SjbJX7XfEixbDxoJB1M.jpg)\n\n![IMG_20230423_114111.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/softa/23uFPUDy4R2P6fNx5tT9MDb1fGhsxwTmgeTegMxRs4nxL4x4CG9juhqBeqbTzbAR8DHBW.jpg)\n\n![IMG_20230423_114301.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/softa/23wC2y46PgiZVuyqqatJFGLr16u8rFEobs9cXZR1JawNhtWCeo2e2e5dYdCqRyV6iBGg3.jpg)\n\nThrough the meadows and the surviving forests, I reached the place where the kyzo slate mine used to be in 17. centrury. Today the mine is flooded and offers quite interesting compositions.\n\n*Přes louky a přeživší lesy jsem došel až k místu kde býval důl na kyzovou břidlici v 17. století.

And it turned out that I would have to wait for several hours. So I decided to adjust my itinerary and head towards the town of Domažlice. On the way, I found myself in the Zelenov (Green) Nature Park, which was quite appropriate at the time, because everything was bright green.\n\n*Původně jsem chtěl pokračovat do Domažlického průsmyku, ale podíval jsem se jaké je spojení z tohoto místa domů. A vyšlo mi že bych musel několik hodin čekat a tak jsem se rozhodl upravit itinerář a vydat se směr město Domažlice. Cestou jsem se ocitl v Přírodním Parku Zelenov, což bylo v danou dobu dosti odpovídající, protože vše bylo jasně zelené.*\n\n![IMG_20230423_123704.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/softa/EnuhKrvU6ZYRxQTqChwtSKqDnsd8mc4TDD3KNfEBTyVjbf3n3wEovWPvGVByGvpXUDr.jpg)\n\n![IMG_20230423_131648.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/softa/Eq7LNM6VfgBLtXAhm7YqaSbLm13RjgkT4gVCpAiCoGAooA6xFFRaJEDY7VbpyDoPU2H.jpg)\n\n![IMG_20230423_132426.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/softa/EpT4DuaWdHmbguLDYRWqRbAJtL4PSWs2b3ip7czMUbsqCpCkWwtrJN6nDjq7KyNLNZw.jpg)\n\n![IMG_20230423_132439.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/softa/23vsZ54QbkJNPxwW9fFsoDtEu5LQ81D6sn7yVXBkR9rHUmpVTAp6Gr8F3FEJL3c39SEqU.jpg)\n\n![IMG_20230423_133953.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/softa/EpJZ5gE8ZFvfQiGrSr6dAkBJK8YH8vmPt9Ei5wiofhLK9UDBa53N9nmyKc9fAuQz5SM.jpg)\n\nAs I approached Domažlice, I had a few more views available, and then through an old avenue composed of maples and acacia trees, I arrived at the train station Domažlice-město.\n\n*Jak jsem se blížil k Domažlicím měl jsem k dispozici ještě pár výhledů a pak skrze starou álej složenou z Javorů a akátů jse dorazil na stanici vlaku Domažlice-město.*\n\n\n![Vserubska.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/softa/Eo6QJv5gRiwDXTEnhDEJ8qQvjzSxsy2D2DobJUda1h2qtNNhvV6Q7dLyakURWRCHveU.jpg)\n\n\n[Map link to Mapy.cz](https://en.mapy.cz/s/dufajezugu)\n\nThese two days in this highland gave me the confidence that after the winter rest I am still able to travel longer distances even at the cost of challenging terrain.

A lot of naysayers are now calling for the end of crypto. Others are saying that this is a key indicator for the end of the bear market and beginning of the bull market.\n\nWho's right? Nobody knows. But surely, we'll find out soon ™️.\n\n## SEC Files Charges Against Binance and Coinbase | Time to Freak Out?\n\nAn [SEC Press Release](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-101) shows the official chargest against Binance. They're saying that Binance was/is:\n\n\"operating unregistered exchanges, broker-dealers, and clearing agencies; misrepresenting trading controls and oversight on the Binance.US platform; and the unregistered offer and sale of securities.\"\n\nAfter years of Binance essentially doing whatever they want and then eventually leaving the US over the past 2 years, this is really unsurprising news.\n\nThe one that's shocking everyone is Coinbase.\n\n## Coinbase\n\nCoinbase is all over the news now and this caused a panic sell event in the crypto space. Nothing like Terra LUNA or FTX crashing but this is still not a good look for the overall industry. \n\n https://images.hive.blog/DQmVbA9FcnNnbH32rwwgKY2fojAcu1pj2ZofqALWiim9F6Q/image.png \n\nThe SEC's actions lately have been super erratic. At one moment, it seems they're meeting with people in the crypto space and looking to act in a collaborative manner. The next moment, they're backstabbing them and filing charges.\n\n https://images.hive.blog/DQmeQoTeUHXTvAc2Jyf8VsrvYbLhoqHnPe4Ps5EyuiNQfXb/image.png \n\nErratic behavior is for the companies. The government is supposed to lead the conversations. They are supposed to both foster innovation while simultaneously protecting individual investors. \n\nThe problem I - and many others - have is that there needs to be regulatory clarity. Whether you're a user of crypto like me or a big company like Coinbase, you need to be able to understand what is and isn't allowed in the regulatory framework.\n\nThere is a lot of certainty for public stock market investing but very little for the crypto industry. \n\nThe ironic thing is that Coinbase filed for their IPO. They got approved by the SEC just 2-3 years ago to become a publicly traded entity.\n\nThat process is super hard. It requires countless months of paperwork and filings and transparency with the SEC.\n\nCoinbase went through all of that and the SEC cleared them to go public... what has changed from then to now?\n\nWell, leadership at the SEC has changed. The view of crypto has changed.\n\nThis all being said, I think it's an incredibly important moment for the U.S. We're on the verge of the printers being turned back on.\n\nWe're seeing a lot of recession fears. We're seeing people scared. We're seeing people unemployed. Record inflation. Low trust in the government and the dollar.\n\nThis is a time to foster innovation and PROFIT from it. The government has a huge opportunity to swoop into crypto and take the industry to all new heights be enacting proper rule sets and profiting off tax dollars. \n\nIt seems they are playing a losing game right now but I hold out hope that a better administration is out there and may succeed where this one is failing. \n\nAs for crypto, it will win either way. The question is: does innovation flee overseas and leave the U.S. or does the U.S. do what it used to be good at and keep it here and thriving?\n\nhttps://images.hive.blog/DQmTXsVnxYGZyRsnSEi4JqHhyzKF6m3Dd1RHT5Nyws5szYf/image.png\n\n## About LeoFinance\n\nLeoFinance is a blockchain-based Web3 community that builds innovative applications on the Hive, BSC, ETH and Polygon blockchains.

Apple has expressed its interest in Augmented Reality technology for years now. As they have repeated several times in the keynote presentation, this device was in works for multiple years now. After going through lengthy updates on all of the Apples product lines, Tim Cook as expected uttered the words - \"We have one more thing to show\". It was time to reveal what everybody has been patiently waiting for - Vision Pro. It seemed as the entire keynote presentation was setup in a way to show the power of augmented reality technology, as speakers were talking about various aspects of different Apple products in different settings.\n\nApple has finally revealed its AR headset, which they named Vision Pro. It is going to be expensive with a price tag of $3500. Considering all the tech they tried to implement within this device, I can see how the price of the device can be justified if it delivers on everything they have presented. From what I am reading, it seems like after the event conference attendees were not able to hold, use, or test the device. It was only available for viewing from distance. They said Vision Pro will be available for purchase in the beginning of next year in the US, and more countries later the same year. I am a bit skeptical about their ability to deliver because they didn't have devices available for developers to try on, and also next years seems too far away. Perhaps there is still more work to be done. While Apple doesn't reveal products they are not confident they can deliver, there have been delays in the past.\n\nPutting aside all of these concerns, Vision Pro looks amazing! We have already seen practical uses of VR headsets. Meta's Quest might be one of the examples of success. It may be due its quality, pricing, and no need for wires and connecting to computers or other devices. It does look like Apple have learned from experiences in virtual reality space and made improvements. VR devices are primarily used in gaming. Apple AR device seems to have multipurpose uses. In fact gaming seems to be a small feature of the device when focus is to bring all the experiences users have had using Apples other products, computers, iphones, ipads, etc.\n\nI am super excited about this product and Apple's entry into the AR headsets space. This just shows how important of a technology this is, more competition will only benefit the consumers, and there are so many use cases I can think of such device can be used it. What I liked from the Apple presentation of the device is that have considered issues previous devices have had, and tried to improve one. Let me list some of these great improvements.\n\n**Resolution.** The device will have a great resolution that users won't see the pixels. One of the problems other devices had was their resolution, and reaching a high resolution in such device is a challenging matter especially if companies try to keep the price of the device affordable for many. For such device to be complete it has to have resolution high enough that pixels are not visible and doesn't cause headache for using long time. It seems like Apple has solved this issue, and the headset can be used for productivity activities, getting work down, reading articles, writing documents, all things we normally do on a computer. Another cool feature was how users would be able to display the screen of their mac computers. Apple has always been good at integrating all devices within its ecosystem. But it also looks like they went extra mile making sure non-Apple software like Microsofts's office products can be used on the device as well.\n\n**Comfort of use.** Since VR and AR devices are stand alone computers they require all kinds of hardware to be packed into small device which would make them heavy. Weight of the device is another challenge that companies have faced and had to balance the quality and comfort of wearing. It is hard to tell how comfortable the Vision Pro will be to wear and for how long without actually trying one. But it looks like they have considered these issues and designed the device to be as comfortable as possible. As it is with all of Apple's products they are good at making improvements year after year. I don't expect Vision Pro to be the best of what Apple can do. But usually at the third release they get most issues resolved. If we wait for more perfect Vision Pro it may take a few more years. But as it is, it does look like Vision Pro will be more comfortable to use than anything available right now. \n\nWhile it is a stand alone device and doesn't need to be connected to other devices with wires. During the presentation they had a wire hanging from the side of the device which kept the viewer wondering what it was for. Towards the end they address that wire, and it turns out they had to come up with additional external battery that would be connected with wire to the side of the device and the external battery itself would be kept in users pocket or just hanging. This doesn't sound like Apple. But I can see why they would do this.  Batteries are usually heavy and removing it from the device itself would remove significant amount of weight. However the problem is this external battery would only power 2-hours of use. It seems the device can be connected to other power sources as well for longer use, not sure how useful that would be.\n\nWhat Apple was good at in the past is making the battery power of its devices last for many hours and which would be sufficient and more that what competitors would offer. In Vision Pro's case it seems like Apple still has some work to do in making battery power last longer. Especially with the price tag of $3500, ability to use the device for two hours at a time doesn't seem to justify the price.\n\n**See through illusion.** When using VR headsets while users sometimes can see their surroundings the don't necessarily interact with their real environment and people around them. Apple have solved this with front screens and technology that displays the eyes of the user as if they are seeing it through the glass. Similarly user can see people around them and change their focus once they engage. It did look seamless in their presentation. Hopefully, it actually works as they have described. This would allow users to be engaged with their real environment and virtual reality at the same time and shift their focus as needed.\n\nVision Pro has many more features. Please visit Apple's website to learn more and definitely watch their keynote presentation to see how awesome this product is. I hope Apple will be successful in delivering this product and reinventing the technology once again. The price of the product does seem to be expensive. But Apple is used to selling products at higher price points, and making it a norm over time. Only time will tell if they can do the same again, or if they will have to reconsider their pricing to attract more people. I have not made up my mind about the Vision Pro yet. I would definitely want to try it. But at this price and it being the first version, I would probably wait for the second generation to arrive. Let me know your thoughts in the comments.","community_title":"LeoFinance","max_accepted_payout":"1000000.000 HBD","beneficiaries":[],"depth":0,"promoted":"0.000 HBD","author_title":"","net_rshares":145522932020621,"json_metadata":{"tags":["hive-167922","apple","visionpro","technology","innovation","ar","vyb","proofofbrain"],"image":["https://images.hive.blog/DQmNgctjsJc2FEm2mXEGzrieF2P1jG2egRGhRmJpNPJdKta/vision_pro.jpg"],"links":["https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/"],"app":"hiveblog/0.1","format":"markdown"},"payout":68.358,"replies":[],"created":"2023-06-06T01:35:24","community":"hive-167922","author_role":"guest","permlink":"vision-pro-apple-continues-to-innovate","author":"geekgirl","payout_at":"2023-06-13T01:35:24","author_payout_value":"0.000 HBD","is_paidout":false,"author_reputation":78.64,"url":"/hive-167922/@geekgirl/vision-pro-apple-continues-to-innovate","active_votes":null,"percent_hbd":10000,"blacklists":[],"title":"Vision Pro - Apple Continues To Innovate","post_id":124195737,"updated":"2023-06-06T01:35:24","category":"hive-167922","stats":{"hide":false,"gray":false,"total_votes":367,"flag_weight":0},"children":19},"ruffatotmeee/bonding-time-with-my-oldie-through-a-morning-walk-and-grocery-shopping":{"pending_payout_value":"63.541 HBD","curator_payout_value":"0.000 HBD","body":"&lt;div class=\"text-justify\"&gt;\n\nEarly in the morning yesterday, Mom asked me to come with her. She was scheduled to withdraw her pension yesterday, and so, of course, as her \"human cane,\" I am required to go with her. This kind of thing, no matter how short our walk is like a family bonding for me. We also had a chance to talk things sometimes. And, I am actually happy for her that day because she can walk again. I mean, the pain in her feet because of arthritis finally fade. And that's the main reason that she can't walk without a cane.\n\n&lt;center&gt;https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/ruffatotmeee/EonjUWtkgrQYfYZvVbRfsKyR6VoGMrngyHotfXWy4E2UuhuVqTY9vo5sRtUCpQGpUoQ.jpg&lt;/center&gt;*&lt;sub&gt;&lt;center&gt;Image Edited in [Canva](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFlC-ycwDw/f7IK51hkSIbj6OKZ_2CrRA/edit?utm_content=DAFlC-ycwDw&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton).&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;*\n\nShe's been enduring that pain for months, I can't even watch her sometimes whenever her face changes because of pain. She's relying too much of pain reliever because of the unbearable pain. She has to do that. especially if she had to attend on important meetings. Even going to the comfort room is just too hard for her. But now, finally! It is thanks to the celery shake that she is drinking every day. She learned about that on Facebook, and when she tried, the pain slowly eased up. Now look at her walking freely like a butterfly, free from any pain.\n\n&lt;div class=\"pull-left\"&gt;https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/ruffatotmeee/EqDjcDaxyRJRtPNFznYoGdYrQqtHGixz3NXu1wcf4VWmEUxSCRJ5Ht1eJeeeB1etw7i.jpg&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"pull-right\"&gt;https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/ruffatotmeee/EqL8LtdRj33GjhEeZMUbFacxR3CgN2spQi2LTQ2rsyV3D3VFThi5dveTa1ph1gvn8S8.jpg&lt;/div&gt;\n\nAnd she seems happier because it is time again to get money from her monthly pension. Actually, she only withdraws it every three months, it's like she's saving it so that she can withdraw more money to use for our everyday lives. She gets $40 every month, and every three months she gets $120. Not bad, it is all the fruit of her labor, getting insurance is not bad at all.\n\n![IMG20230605074636.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/ruffatotmeee/EorzoWh1yPYpFcMzisKAcAUXsM84zv2ezueCh3Q9GdFxjcoMBP4d2VCEASFP8nmBDBM.jpg)\n\nIt is really a beautiful day to go for a walk. We went there earlier, when the sun was not that itchy to the skin. And after getting her money, she planned to go to the grocery store to buy some things. Some of those things are just for Mommy D's mini store.\n\n&lt;div class=\"pull-left\"&gt;https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/ruffatotmeee/Ep3eptevNnX3Czu7hWpATfXjLjoZL3qSkurzcALNqDkEzBwhUYoA46AepDJJPNXvdkZ.jpg&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"pull-right\"&gt;https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/ruffatotmeee/Eq5DVH6ChZxJcMUV3yppZ7pjamE1pMN9Q8Z6ojVCbMz4souA8G6o58W9GNdPiFotdL1.jpg&lt;/div&gt;\n\nAnd while we're on this, I am looking around to feast my eyes on the beauty of our surroundings. This is really what I need right now. Being contained in my room is kind of suffocating sometimes, and I can't help but look for something new. And indulge myself because, why not? I need it, even just a few minutes of breathing and a change of surroundings are enough for me. And at the end of the day, I will still look back to my own world, where I can lay, sing, and dance without minding the outside world.\n\n![IMG20230605074843.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/ruffatotmeee/EopuLNXrZ62ChZSGydKfVECnkmBuQkCnit6192dRDuSXHRsNW4dQq3nyScrCBRRzt3i.jpg)\n\nI'm just like this cute dog here when I am in a comfortable place, lying comfortably and just sleeping soundly in his favorite spot. The owner of this cutie here is the teller at this little shop, where we always withdrew some money. A place with a dog or cat in it is a beautiful place for me, because I know they also love animals and are  pet lovers. I'm sad I couldn't take a picture of her pretty face.\n\n![IMG20230605075345.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/ruffatotmeee/242hRquXyf2cPrLLpXHuyJsg9zFsddee8uTJCRW4en2w42pAGgHhJJyNizrtNzHydV9c4.jpg)\n\nAfter finishing our business at that place, we opt to visit the nearby grocery store. We didn't stay there for long, though.\n\n![IMG20230605075926.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/ruffatotmeee/EpCATdRWTiKAjxWiUtH8qYQvxhX6R7PNpmivdby8QbA7A5pAKojt1PyvUoBoJPHyTSb.jpg)\n\nWe just bought a few things, and then off we go. But to be honest, there are a lot of products that I want to buy. Mostly food, it's sad that I don't have money at that time. But well, even if I did, I think I would not just open my pocket in there. I prioritize my needs over wants, but of course, I know when to reward myself and indulge my cravings and wants. Not that often, though, just a few times. Even getting my favorite foods, like those full of \"carbs,\" is a luxury to me.\n\n![IMG20230605075904.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/ruffatotmeee/Ep3ePsBNG6hU6ds8FWGkJJEc7kYKDbM6jrdCuYgLr3hzhaTRvv8umMCGujju2TLoyii.jpg)\n\nI am so tempted, but I can't. Imagine those things in front of you, you want to grab them badly, but you can't because you have to prioritize things. Ah, how painful that is. I'm sure a lot of people can relate to this. Why can't we just have it all?\n\n&lt;div class=\"pull-left\"&gt;https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/ruffatotmeee/EpGRgZikPAbPBTK6eNM579K4vwwGRsxHE6fou9pypLpCyBCDbNf4sJG7VkfJfrg3GpG.jpg&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"pull-right\"&gt;https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/ruffatotmeee/EpQvovVqAdU4bux31r6QFiZRMk2mAh8xWyLdMdTKvhChwrDXjVvM7VvnZ5csjrN3pzW.jpg&lt;/div&gt;\n\nI feel like grabbing all the alcohol here and drinking it all, lol. But seriously speaking, I also want to grab one and get all drunk, even just for one day. I haven't really experienced what it's like to get drunk, I want to experience that, but I'm afraid that I might do an embarrassing thing. The purpose of trying it is to see if I will enjoy it and just for experience, not to embarrass myself, lol. I'm with my oldies, so it'll be hard to try that.\n\nThere are just too many things I haven't experienced yet. I hope someday I get the chance to do all of that.\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n![20220714_175943_0000-removebg-preview.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/ruffatotmeee/23tS2j2zDPggQCMAQafSUYiJF8KsLZpHPwSqE849NkCC6bFA8YKz3JHbVccREjb11y9P7.png)","community_title":"Wednesday Walk","max_accepted_payout":"1000000.000 HBD","beneficiaries":[{"account":"anonymous02","weight":300},{"account":"hiveonboard","weight":100},{"account":"tipu","weight":100}],"depth":0,"promoted":"0.000 HBD","author_title":"","net_rshares":135227391621972,"json_metadata":{"app":"peakd/2023.6.2","format":"markdown","tags":["wednesdaywalk","familybonding","familytime","shopping","hiveph","neoxian","palnet","pob"],"users":[],"image":["https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/ruffatotmeee/EonjUWtkgrQYfYZvVbRfsKyR6VoGMrngyHotfXWy4E2UuhuVqTY9vo5sRtUCpQGpUoQ.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/ruffatotmeee/EqDjcDaxyRJRtPNFznYoGdYrQqtHGixz3NXu1wcf4VWmEUxSCRJ5Ht1eJeeeB1etw7i.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/ruffatotmeee/EqL8LtdRj33GjhEeZMUbFacxR3CgN2spQi2LTQ2rsyV3D3VFThi5dveTa1ph1gvn8S8.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/ruffatotmeee/EorzoWh1yPYpFcMzisKAcAUXsM84zv2ezueCh3Q9GdFxjcoMBP4d2VCEASFP8nmBDBM.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/ruffatotmeee/Ep3eptevNnX3Czu7hWpATfXjLjoZL3qSkurzcALNqDkEzBwhUYoA46AepDJJPNXvdkZ.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/ruffatotmeee/Eq5DVH6ChZxJcMUV3yppZ7pjamE1pMN9Q8Z6ojVCbMz4souA8G6o58W9GNdPiFotdL1.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/ruffatotmeee/EopuLNXrZ62ChZSGydKfVECnkmBuQkCnit6192dRDuSXHRsNW4dQq3nyScrCBRRzt3i.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/ruffatotmeee/242hRquXyf2cPrLLpXHuyJsg9zFsddee8uTJCRW4en2w42pAGgHhJJyNizrtNzHydV9c4.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/ruffatotmeee/EpCATdRWTiKAjxWiUtH8qYQvxhX6R7PNpmivdby8QbA7A5pAKojt1PyvUoBoJPHyTSb.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/ruffatotmeee/Ep3ePsBNG6hU6ds8FWGkJJEc7kYKDbM6jrdCuYgLr3hzhaTRvv8umMCGujju2TLoyii.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/ruffatotmeee/EpGRgZikPAbPBTK6eNM579K4vwwGRsxHE6fou9pypLpCyBCDbNf4sJG7VkfJfrg3GpG.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/ruffatotmeee/EpQvovVqAdU4bux31r6QFiZRMk2mAh8xWyLdMdTKvhChwrDXjVvM7VvnZ5csjrN3pzW.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/ruffatotmeee/23tS2j2zDPggQCMAQafSUYiJF8KsLZpHPwSqE849NkCC6bFA8YKz3JHbVccREjb11y9P7.png"]},"payout":63.541,"replies":[],"created":"2023-06-06T12:00:36","community":"hive-155530","author_role":"guest","permlink":"bonding-time-with-my-oldie-through-a-morning-walk-and-grocery-shopping","author":"ruffatotmeee","payout_at":"2023-06-13T12:00:36","author_payout_value":"0.000 HBD","is_paidout":false,"author_reputation":68.53,"url":"/hive-155530/@ruffatotmeee/bonding-time-with-my-oldie-through-a-morning-walk-and-grocery-shopping","active_votes":null,"percent_hbd":10000,"blacklists":[],"title":"Bonding Time with My Oldie Through a Morning Walk and Grocery Shopping","post_id":124206009,"updated":"2023-06-06T12:00:36","category":"hive-155530","stats":{"hide":false,"gray":false,"total_votes":308,"flag_weight":0},"children":10},"carolynstahl/southern-style-spice-rubbed-cauliflower-steaks":{"pending_payout_value":"36.009 HBD","curator_payout_value":"0.000 HBD","body":"\n![DSC_6044.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/carolynstahl/23xydLDTD2NNEBCf4btEuyM7EN4Rgp6pV25SE7zuM8T7Wc8XTEaSbqBtyJYc8FrBp8oiV.jpg)\n\nThe seasonings I've used for this cauliflower could probably be called Cajun, creole or blackened. While they supposedly are slightly different, I don't bother trying to distinguish the difference between this southern style of spice mix. Cajun would probably be the spiciest using hot pepper and/or cayenne pepper. I'm sure that no matter what name is given to the spice mix, it would still vary from household to household.\n\n*A southerner could probably set me straight.*\n\nFor me it was a blackened steak and chicken that we would make at a former job in a restaurant years ago, that introduced me to this style of spice cooking. \n\nIt was a combination of pepper, cayenne, garlic powder and onion powder. The meat would be well coated in the spice then pan fried or grilled.\n\nI'm sure that no matter the name given to the spice mix, it could still vary from household to household. \n\nI am Canadian so I will make my own based on the variations and my personal taste. \n\n\n\n![DSC_5899.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/carolynstahl/23wMm3Rkqb2cjuYBqcAHVTCbVEfSaDMsbc9P9XsDQr4AK95HuQs91kdHcymqZADNV7wB9.jpg)\n\nI no longer eat meat or fish so cauliflower will substitute. It seems to be more and more popular to turn cauliflower into steaks and pan fry them or bake. Since cauliflower is generally bland, I think it can be flavoured any way desired. \n\n![DSC_5927.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/carolynstahl/23w2qC32DsXHnoejEZNbEAUtrr7KHTHMvJXLg1fMsNb3ckzS7NBMAPALFozQxpW34xP3E.jpg)\n\nThe thing about cutting these into steaks is that you won't have that many perfect slices unless you can get your hands on a very large cauliflower. \n\nI could only get a very small one for a decent price. \n\n![DSC_5916.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/carolynstahl/23wgYN9VnwyVj371T3vCbue8mhxVkC7MbccAumC9Zqyw8GGrjeqhioM3bR4m3DRmNyQew.jpg)\n\nFrom this small cauliflower I was only able to get three steaks. Two for Marc and one for me. No worries I coated the florets that were left in the same spice mix for an extra plate.\n\n![DSC_5940.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/carolynstahl/23vi1wyTBPsHsYonZKwUwfCQ4RmJQK2xCNs7rp77L2KWrEGRzRVTeLoJN3nXc3QtToxFA.jpg)\n\n**Spice rub**\n1 tablespoon black pepper\n1 tablespoon paprika\n1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika\n1 tablespoon chili powder\n1 tablespoon garlic powder\n1 tablespoon onion powder\n1 teaspoon thyme\nSalt to taste\n\n![DSC_5931.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/carolynstahl/23xL5DxUdsQ7FDWqMngWtFG86E7GJkchvMvrhaK2ZN1XHBTV5uqWoshLnpY4PEiG8opTb.jpg)\n\n \nIn the past I've blanched the cauliflower first but didn't like the results.  I don't like soft cauliflower unless it's being turned into a puree or cream soup. I wanted a meatier texture. Cooked all the way through but still with a good bite.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![DSC_5945.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/carolynstahl/23wX1Xth65CYvQWPgEzs68wSq4qdARhVYiP65LdnWgUaWPj6J56phJifrzdjr1psxUbuo.jpg)\n\nCoat the cauliflower well after dampening with water. You could use flour or bread crumbs as well. I chose not to. I was going to have sauce and potato puree so that would include the flour.\n\n![DSC_5949.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/carolynstahl/23wCQtb33vHbvEzYLEQKwKmyWQyw8BLvuxjQorqgScxSHhKAr1MAfYGnhnFDk2pBLhgpe.jpg)\n\n**Mushroom parsley sauce**\n1 litre vegetable broth\n450 grams mushrooms (I used portobellos)\n1 carrot\n100 grams onion\n25 grams garlic\n100 grams parsley\n3 tablespoons flour\n2 tablespoons butter\n1 tablespoon  oil\n1 teaspoon pepper\n1 teaspoon onion powder\n2 bay leaves\n1/2 teaspoon thyme Salt to taste\n\n\n![DSC_5985.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/carolynstahl/23w2weDU9LXN7yAhdH9aJooB9UG1ze8vp4XD5j8vWvhG1Hnjo4tmq8ZHPkbsddiKpQUiT.jpg)\n\nSaute onions, and garlic in oil and butter.

After this I simmered for around 30 minutes. I removed the bay leaves. cooled and blended until smooth.\n\n![DSC_5999.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/carolynstahl/23uFaS4hnTExbGkkF6qk9uFatis2qiQWNtaMJ4GN64eSjnXW3FkW7qFdvhLJSNNraMUg1.jpg)\n\n**Potato puree** \n900 grams potatoes\n1 cup broth\n2 cups soy milk or other milk\n1 teaspoon butter\nSalt and pepper to taste\n\n![DSC_5920.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/carolynstahl/23xpHSizPtn2Dhxudjf6qEEp8nE1QCK9DzdZXCyCopb4X9bSC5qPyv2WudixwQhoUr3Vi.jpg)\n\nThe potatoes were fairly waxy so my plan to have mashed potatoes turned to a puree instead. I actually thought the smoothness of the sauce and puree was a good compliment to the texture of the cauliflower.\n\nI added the liquids as I blended with a hand blender. I used milk, butter and also broth, but sometimes I only use broth. *My weigh scale says I shouldn't use butter, but I told the scale where to go*.\n\n![DSC_6009.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/carolynstahl/23w2uVm7kCF8TqDzUJ7DrhtDvcC5rJTTWuvSHCWbfWFPvHcPQRCjpSaJgJXNU6Ra3V4BL.jpg)\n\nI wanted to include something green to the dish, so I chose collards. When I think of the deep south, I think of things like collard greens. I love the texture which, in my opinion is like a perfect blend of cabbage and kale. I am pretty sure they are from the same family. \n\n\n![DSC_5966.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/carolynstahl/23zGcDM2mb42yQf6BVSgQiz73nsvUMvT1qn9rcPT4BhHxZWuxJiTQcEgEddgmS22kVHxG.jpg)\n\n\n**Creamy Collard greens**\n500 grams collard greens\n100 grams onion\n20 grams garlic\n1 cup soy cream\n1 cup soy milk\n2 tablespoon vegan butter\n2 tablespoon flour \n\n![DSC_6013.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/carolynstahl/23wMmQgsXToQ7omiYeVSUtYJMdNskagrMLE4YNsFJVRPD8ZCek5NFZxZi2GLszBhZ76fb.jpg)\n\nThis started out much like the sauce. Cook the onions, garlic in oil and butter, slowly add milk and cream and whisk until smooth.\n\nAdd the greens and cook until tender but still green in colour.\n\n![DSC_6017.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/carolynstahl/23yd7oBVbKRfp2vfyZiWStjxuanZTedJeLKsEaH4w8MBvA6GZypVCVJ1dMyBp7vjENnrt.jpg)\n\nIn a pan with hot oil, sear the cauliflower flipping over a couple of times.   Cook each side for around two minutes or until tender. Without water it won't get too soft. \n\nSome people sear it then put it in the oven. I didn't do it and it was tender enough for me. Of course you could do it in the oven only but I wanted to recreate the blackened dishes we used to make at the restaurant. It can also be grilled which I may do next time on my electric grill.\n\n![DSC_6021.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/carolynstahl/23yJ8KERP1HLKP8uDB35fTCbpr39YmcZufEV7vc7ej4y7uL47qauFTTekGDTnuAyQLWp4.jpg)\n\nThis was a rich dish which could be made with fewer calories and less fat. I was in the mood for good old southern, stick to your ribs, plant based version of a southern dish.\n\n*Yes I know what you may be thinking. An old fashion southern dish would not be plant based traditionally. Well this is the actor that plays the part okay? We don't need an academy award. We just want to eat something tasty.*\n\n![DSC_6035.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/carolynstahl/23vsSyL5st9LD2K89qWV9rAh7ZmPe7z9ZE114LaFWaX6o4fo64EkVSnZ7tvEm4a4zWHVP.jpg)\n\nThe spices had quite a bit of heat to it, but if you don't like that you can eliminate the cayenne and use only sweet paprika. \n\n\n![DSC_6024.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/carolynstahl/23zkteS16zAfyFN457nuFd66fyHGCKLopqrAEDoLUccmxwzaz3CajgbCuiqtKJ4ZDJSAp.jpg)\n\n\nEven though this was cauliflower rather then meat, it was still satisfying and filling. \n\n\n\nhttps://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/carolynstahl/242DLeTbivS78h8Y7JH3eAbZCvBVgHMMeayc9jdYYrCbFgggYvLqkXgWp19LLzCFTbeUc.jpg\n\nThanks for dropping by and have a great day.\n\n&lt;center&gt;[![carolynbanner.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/kidsisters/23zbakG8bjP7Hi7JDdb66QFQPcjEPUfSnCDw5cAieeT3a9t34szvYGmqdC9ZHi5RRtSNg.jpg)](https://peakd.com/@carolynstahl/posts)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;**design by: @KidSisters**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n\n*Photos taken with a Nikon D7500 by me, except for the ones of me, taken by my other half.*","community_title":"Plant Power (Vegan)","max_accepted_payout":"1000000.000 HBD","beneficiaries":[{"account":"peakd","weight":500}],"depth":0,"promoted":"0.000 HBD","author_title":"","net_rshares":76646123995393,"json_metadata":{"app":"peakd/2023.6.2","format":"markdown","tags":["foodies","vegan","lotus","creativecuisine","hivefood","silverbloggers","ocd","pob","photos","cooking"],"users":["carolynstahl","KidSisters"],"image":["https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/carolynstahl/23xydLDTD2NNEBCf4btEuyM7EN4Rgp6pV25SE7zuM8T7Wc8XTEaSbqBtyJYc8FrBp8oiV.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/carolynstahl/23wMm3Rkqb2cjuYBqcAHVTCbVEfSaDMsbc9P9XsDQr4AK95HuQs91kdHcymqZADNV7wB9.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/carolynstahl/23w2qC32DsXHnoejEZNbEAUtrr7KHTHMvJXLg1fMsNb3ckzS7NBMAPALFozQxpW34xP3E.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/carolynstahl/23wgYN9VnwyVj371T3vCbue8mhxVkC7MbccAumC9Zqyw8GGrjeqhioM3bR4m3DRmNyQew.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/carolynstahl/23vi1wyTBPsHsYonZKwUwfCQ4RmJQK2xCNs7rp77L2KWrEGRzRVTeLoJN3nXc3QtToxFA.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/carolynstahl/23xL5DxUdsQ7FDWqMngWtFG86E7GJkchvMvrhaK2ZN1XHBTV5uqWoshLnpY4PEiG8opTb.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/carolynstahl/23wX1Xth65CYvQWPgEzs68wSq4qdARhVYiP65LdnWgUaWPj6J56phJifrzdjr1psxUbuo.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/carolynstahl/23wCQtb33vHbvEzYLEQKwKmyWQyw8BLvuxjQorqgScxSHhKAr1MAfYGnhnFDk2pBLhgpe.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/carolynstahl/23w2weDU9LXN7yAhdH9aJooB9UG1ze8vp4XD5j8vWvhG1Hnjo4tmq8ZHPkbsddiKpQUiT.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/carolynstahl/23wgKURVkRgaem4WJQ5zkGc4KpdsjpyqASFVTzZJbHcNgt3Ej25YUC3R8kvQ7gWcZtRny.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/carolynstahl/23wWrbK9QvW8u2RqshA2r9WWaQUvjuDVxY3R2NTsS3PupsF94WZHxscnrAy3xBH79zkKT.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/carolynstahl/23xpF161FpQf6P2UJHPS5LV99wcNweFoPq7HAT6x6EpMGt1TGdykBixH2C6Ye9ngbiu8b.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/carolynstahl/23uFaS4hnTExbGkkF6qk9uFatis2qiQWNtaMJ4GN64eSjnXW3FkW7qFdvhLJSNNraMUg1.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/carolynstahl/23xpHSizPtn2Dhxudjf6qEEp8nE1QCK9DzdZXCyCopb4X9bSC5qPyv2WudixwQhoUr3Vi.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/carolynstahl/23w2uVm7kCF8TqDzUJ7DrhtDvcC5rJTTWuvSHCWbfWFPvHcPQRCjpSaJgJXNU6Ra3V4BL.jpg"]},"payout":36.009,"replies":[],"created":"2023-06-06T20:32:36","community":"hive-180569","author_role":"guest","permlink":"southern-style-spice-rubbed-cauliflower-steaks","author":"carolynstahl","payout_at":"2023-06-13T20:32:36","author_payout_value":"0.000 HBD","is_paidout":false,"author_reputation":75.73,"url":"/hive-180569/@carolynstahl/southern-style-spice-rubbed-cauliflower-steaks","active_votes":null,"percent_hbd":10000,"blacklists":[],"title":"Southern style spice rubbed cauliflower steaks ","post_id":124217376,"updated":"2023-06-06T20:32:36","category":"hive-180569","stats":{"hide":false,"gray":false,"total_votes":335,"flag_weight":0},"children":7},"weeklytops/authors-of-the-week-or-week-22":{"pending_payout_value":"103.703 HBD","curator_payout_value":"0.000 HBD","body":"This is an initiative that aims to reward the best content creators on Hive picked by the community through decentralized Polls on Threads, while doing a coordinated effort to promote Hive on web2 social media platforms.

how the Lion Pride has responded to this call, a call that is only a taste of what is to come and shows how much growth potential we have as the biggest community in the Hive Blockchain.\n\nLast time everyone showed their power and defeated some bosses. Each Lion fought individually to defeat some easy, and some hard to beat bosses, but this final battle is different.\n\nTo close this adoption campaign, we want to invite you to...\n\n### The battle of the Three Armies\n\n https://images.hive.blog/DQmUBf3XkmKtAEwjKLrRYzoGYFQag2YTdEUiJG8ZNFPyNqw/Final%20battle.png\n\nYou heard correctly, we will have three different teams on Threads fighting each other, and only one team will come out on top of the other two.\n\nThe metric is no longer amount of Threads, it's a little more complicated, because we now have a **Scoreboard**.\n\n&gt; This scoreboard takes into account the amount of characters, the amount of replies you make to other threads, the amount of replies your threads get, and how many different Lions you engage with.\n\nSo this is not about checking what team threads the most, but also about what team engages the best, with real interactions and real conversations on Threads!\n\n**The battle will last only one day, Friday, June 9 UTC time zone**\n\nSo save the date, we will put out a post with more details about this Final Battle tomorrow!\n\nIn the meantime, let me share with you the prize distribution of our adoption campaign.\n\n### Adoption Campaign Prize Distribution\n\nThe Prize pool will be distributed as follows:\n\n**Out of the Total Prize Pool:**\n\n* 1st Tier: 45% will go to the top 3 spots\n\n* 2nd Tier: 25% will go to the 4-10 places\n\n* 3rd Tier: 15% will go to the 11-20 places\n\n* 4th Tier: 10% will go to the 21-30 places\n\n* 5th Tier: 5% will go to the 31-40 places\n\nWe will sum ALL the experience points made by each Tier, and then each Lion part of that Tier will receive a proportional amount of their own pool depending on how many points they have.\n\n&gt; *For example, let's say that the total points from the Lions from Tier 1 is 600k Experience points. If Lion A who is part of Tier 1 made 200k points, then Lion A will receive 33% of the prize pool of the 1st Tier = 1500 USD*\n\nGot it? Read that again, don't ask on discord! Try reading this twice because it is pretty clear! :D\n\n### Schedule Change\n\n#### Remember the Influencer Adventures?\n\n https://images.hive.blog/DQmZX3xrRL7u7o7zDsGvDtJ2WDdSUBYcncnyfK8tRQLYAnb/image.png \n\nWell, we moved the dates and now you have until June 9 to finish them, so keep grinding Lions!\n\nGood luck and I hope you climb some Tiers so you get a better prize!\n\nPosted Using [LeoFinance Alpha](https://leofinance.io/@anomadsoul/leo-finance-adoption-campaign-final-battle-prize-distribution-and-a-schedule-update)","community_title":"LeoFinance","max_accepted_payout":"1000000.000 HBD","beneficiaries":[{"account":"leofinance","weight":5}],"depth":0,"promoted":"0.000 HBD","author_title":"","net_rshares":151482450890880,"json_metadata":{"app":"leothreads/0.3","format":"markdown","tags":["hive-167922","leofinance","zealy","adoption","campaign","onboarding","vyb","proofofbrain"],"canonical_url":"https://leofinance.io/@anomadsoul/leo-finance-adoption-campaign-final-battle-prize-distribution-and-a-schedule-update","links":["https://leofinance.io/@anomadsoul/leo-finance-adoption-campaign-final-battle-prize-distribution-and-a-schedule-update)"],"images":["https://images.hive.blog/DQmUBf3XkmKtAEwjKLrRYzoGYFQag2YTdEUiJG8ZNFPyNqw/Final%20battle.png","https://images.hive.blog/DQmZX3xrRL7u7o7zDsGvDtJ2WDdSUBYcncnyfK8tRQLYAnb/image.png"]},"payout":71.165,"replies":[],"created":"2023-06-06T03:31:54","community":"hive-167922","author_role":"guest","permlink":"leo-finance-adoption-campaign-final-battle-prize-distribution-and-a-schedule-update","author":"anomadsoul","payout_at":"2023-06-13T03:31:54","author_payout_value":"0.000 HBD","is_paidout":false,"author_reputation":80.16,"url":"/hive-167922/@anomadsoul/leo-finance-adoption-campaign-final-battle-prize-distribution-and-a-schedule-update","active_votes":null,"percent_hbd":10000,"blacklists":[],"title":"Leo Finance Adoption Campaign - Final Battle, Prize Distribution and a Schedule update","post_id":124197655,"updated":"2023-06-06T03:31:54","category":"hive-167922","stats":{"hide":false,"gray":false,"total_votes":655,"flag_weight":0},"children":16},"samstonehill/the-delicious-joys-of-summer-and-a-my-first-job-as-a-food-producer-selling-salad-to-the-local-restaurant":{"pending_payout_value":"64.609 HBD","curator_payout_value":"0.000 HBD","body":"\n![signal-2023-05-27-174030_002 2.jpeg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/samstonehill/EoGyRbQnsB3UpkFaA2Z5zqaHWbYpgj2BzrCWUqxt3tYpJZXAGw9SQzGqsyqSKZ95GhS.jpeg)\n\nWe went to the beach with @thecogent recently and I was reminded once more why we live here.

And so I will scratch my itch now with a quick review of all the different things which have happened in the last ten days.  Most of them food related.\n\n## My first job as an [electroculture](https://peakd.com/c/hive-198415/created) salad producer\n\n\n![IMG_4562.jpeg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/samstonehill/EqWmDF2Nq5ACsbmazmkzH16cqLarBG2usP3irRuiidmnP9DgvQ4jcPFdzs98p32G91p.jpeg)\n\n\nWord is getting around that I have the best lettuce in town and our local restaurant, which is particularly good, have asked that I supply them this Summer with fresh produce.\n\nSo it was with a great amount of pleasure that Esteban & I prepared this salad box for them yesterday.\n\n\n![IMG_4829.jpeg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/samstonehill/EpzzfZAs3HZq5epXYyePKHQU6C9bCkp1F9CZyUyNcchnRCPHHS9KWK78EHyqeWDcQ2c.jpeg)\n\nBought new digital scales especially for this!\n\n\n\n![IMG_4832.jpeg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/samstonehill/23xefWWkZe2gkVRiqVj77bcjm9uJ4dj12mBwiCfXpxvhBTjv3gCEcTSZb5icwykhZFJDk.jpeg)\n\nAnd made our delivery promptly at 9am.\n\n![IMG_4833.jpeg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/samstonehill/Eos2JSFmVtgN9WcuXFYtbzUhwrwQ8fujWKw16nZW5yBehLD38GCByf1QXRV5errq6vG.jpeg)\n\nThis is the chef.

Can't eat it quick enough in fact.\n\nSo Esteban & I ran to the garden and collected more.\n\nTwo types of kale, beetroot leaf and sorrel here.\n\n![IMG_4840.jpeg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/samstonehill/EoAbBQUbmg82QyJodnsXQhhBn6pFNHUuP2LeWCVPJJgttXjSAgFRfnmKLLPXnw15gch.jpeg)\n\n\nA couple of small classic lettuces.\n\n![IMG_4841.jpeg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/samstonehill/EpT3dBkf1jkxFwb2GNsEfdz1epZWjgQdJ1Ugn7MhyV9gUMwaYBMKb3sQ7CvLQYb51Sp.jpeg)\n\nPlus a frizzy lettuce and some mint & chives.\n\n![IMG_4847.jpeg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/samstonehill/EoEpcwHzYubeXpp2qvNk463kzfC6GstzfPV7r9CrSRB819eaTcVoEb2MMaFtfUsfiMh.jpeg)\n\nDespite Esteban's assurances it would be okay we did not deliver the salad in a dustin lid.  We took it home, washed it and presented it in a suitable box.  \n\nI charge them €15 per kilogram of washed salad (lettuce only) and €17 per kilogram for the other stuff like kale, mint, sorrel & chives.  Don't really know if this is a good or bad deal but I feel happy with it.\n\nYesterday's delivery made me around €20 and if everything goes to plan this summer (100 people a day sitting on their terrace during lunch and dinner) I will be making at least €50 per week.  For now they only offer salad as a starter (and also as a garnish with every dish) but I believe I can persuade them to do a salad as a main.\n\n\n![IMG_8957.jpeg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/samstonehill/EpXLrkgpzpKUsUhrLBxNmokNiqvk3jazmWzt3RCMPo8szF148Gwv7RTtrCcxkzQXmmJ.jpeg)\n\nEspecially once I have rocket, mustard, parsley, basil, tomatoes, peppers, cucamelons & cucumbers to throw in the mix.\n\nCosmic cone cucumbers no less!\n\n\n![IMG_4958.jpeg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/samstonehill/EonkvQb89DrPMEyj7RMSmTEPF1ma1LQa6fbbhpJesUtAcQiod1mxkxBhN37GKzxY9LH.jpeg)\n \nWill tell you more about this 51° cone (modelled on the Irish round tower) in a dedicated post, by which time the cucumbers will have grown up it a bit.\n\nHard to say exactly what it is when we have so many different electroculture devices on the go now but everything on our land is just looking so great.\n\n\n![IMG_4966.jpeg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/samstonehill/Eoc7TfxYT3GSbuD8rmtVeVcg2iyd6o7Cwz8s6yCTFfaFWJ9AwCCzLqdCrd4hJeA5su4.jpeg)\n\n\nWhat about these mangetout?

The design is not only attractive but also interesting, ensuring that pupils properly comprehend its purpose.\n\nThe actual brilliance of these books rests in their interaction with the Hive blockchain. Each book has a unique field that students may use for personal details and learning activities throughout their studies. This results in a smooth integration of conventional learning with digital technologies, which improves the educational experience.\n\n\n![p2.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/mcsamm/48WhsV158SB6jo8Rfb5ArqZxxapRHpnga26epTRREY4hn7xCxg2VxLP8QDMzkyi3bn.png)\n\n     Old hive notebooks\n\n\nEducation should be accessible and affordable to everyone, and the Hive Branded Books are built with this philosophy in mind. Efforts have been made to make the books free for everyone in order to reach as many students as possible. Furthermore, the support of the Hive blockchain enables a massive distribution approach, making it simpler to spread the books among schools and communities.\n\n##### Impactful Collaborations: \nThe Hive Ghana leadership and various stakeholders have all worked together to make this idea a reality. These partners are dedicated to achieving good change in Ghana's education system and empowering children for a better future by combining resources and expertise.\n\nThe unveiling of new Hive-branded books, we feel, will have a huge influence on education in Ghana. We can offer children access to a plethora of information, excite their imaginations, and nurture a lifelong love of learning by using the possibilities of blockchain technology.\n\n\n![image (1).png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/mcsamm/244ohmg9WhaaZUqTQ8umBwFEpVfH9WryqT6BXGEZveZ2T4y29U8seV4JyPwWkDBEEgqmf.png)\n\n     New Hive Notebooks\n\nWe believe that through this empowerment initiative, we will see an educational revolution in which Ghanaian students will be equipped with the skills and resources they need to flourish in a rapidly changing world.

Feat Factory is a haunted house in Salt Lake City.\n\nThe Fear Factory haunted house is an old cement factory from the 1800s. There have been 11 confirmed deaths in the factory and probably so many more. Here is an excerpt from the Fear Factory website:\n\n&gt; George Howe, charged with the maintenance of the coal crusher, was one such worker. One evening, George was alone in the factory oiling the crusher before shutting it down for the night. As he reached across to apply oil deep within the crusher, the machine grabbed his sleeve and began slowly pulling him into its gears. George’s arm was first removed from the socket, then snapped and ripped from his body. Unable to free himself, the man was slowly, but consciously, pulled into the crusher. The roaring machinery and the solid factory walls silenced his cries. George Howe’s entire body was eventually twisted into the gears before being spit out as nothing more than a torn and mutilated collection of bloody flesh. Other deaths include falling into boiling vats, additional grindings, death by suicide via the train, dismemberment, and many others.&lt;sup&gt;[source](https://fearfactoryslc.com/history/)&lt;/sup&gt;\n\nIt is a pretty cool haunted house, and the fact that it is haunted for real makes it even spookier to walk through. The haunted house experience is pretty crazy as you wind through the tunnels, up the old stairs and basically all over the entire factory. \n\nOne thing that I love about the haunted houses here in Utah is that they really put a lot of work in their costumes. There are so many people that work at the haunted houses during the Halloween season and it is crazy to think of how much work goes into putting the makeup and prosthetics on them. \n\nI hope that you enjoyed these photos and appreciate the talent that it took to create these spooky costumes. Thanks for stopping by and checking it out. \n\n---\n\nFor the best experience view this post on [Liketu](https://liketu.com/@derangedvisions/haunted-pride)","community_title":"Photography Lovers","max_accepted_payout":"1000000.000 HBD","beneficiaries":[{"account":"liketu","weight":100}],"depth":0,"promoted":"0.000 HBD","author_title":"Photo Nerd","net_rshares":81859090310150,"json_metadata":{"community":"liketu","app":"liketu","format":"markdown","tags":["photography","haunted","spooky","portraits","pride","parade"],"users":"","links":"","image":"","flow":{"tags":["photography","haunted","spooky","portraits","pride","parade"],"pictures":[{"id":471480,"name":"clikovdhr00916wszei0l88g2_fearfactory-6013.webp","mime":"image/webp","url":"https://cdn.liketu.com/media/derangedvisions/images/clikovdhr00916wszei0l88g2_fearfactory-6013/clikovdhr00916wszei0l88g2_fearfactory-6013.webp","tags":[],"caption":""},{"id":471479,"name":"clikovc7r00a53wszh3jcdfzm_fearfactory-6014.webp","mime":"image/webp","url":"https://cdn.liketu.com/media/derangedvisions/images/clikovc7r00a53wszh3jcdfzm_fearfactory-6014/clikovc7r00a53wszh3jcdfzm_fearfactory-6014.webp","tags":[],"caption":""},{"id":471481,"name":"clikovg2p009w7mszauopbgu2_fearfactory-6015.webp","mime":"image/webp","url":"https://cdn.liketu.com/media/derangedvisions/images/clikovg2p009w7mszauopbgu2_fearfactory-6015/clikovg2p009w7mszauopbgu2_fearfactory-6015.webp","tags":[],"caption":""},{"id":471482,"name":"clikovhnm009592sz6bnlafmf_fearfactory-6020.webp","mime":"image/webp","url":"https://cdn.liketu.com/media/derangedvisions/images/clikovhnm009592sz6bnlafmf_fearfactory-6020/clikovhnm009592sz6bnlafmf_fearfactory-6020.webp","tags":[],"caption":""},{"id":471483,"name":"clikovkid00872fsz6hrc1ror_fearfactory-6022.webp","mime":"image/webp","url":"https://cdn.liketu.com/media/derangedvisions/images/clikovkid00872fsz6hrc1ror_fearfactory-6022/clikovkid00872fsz6hrc1ror_fearfactory-6022.webp","tags":[],"caption":""},{"id":471484,"name":"clikovndu008l9jsz1bpt7wpi_fearfactory-6023.webp","mime":"image/webp","url":"https://cdn.liketu.com/media/derangedvisions/images/clikovndu008l9jsz1bpt7wpi_fearfactory-6023/clikovndu008l9jsz1bpt7wpi_fearfactory-6023.webp","tags":[],"caption":""},{"id":471485,"name":"clikovpv300b549sz1m6018bc_fearfactory-6026.webp","mime":"image/webp","url":"https://cdn.liketu.com/media/derangedvisions/images/clikovpv300b549sz1m6018bc_fearfactory-6026/clikovpv300b549sz1m6018bc_fearfactory-6026.webp","tags":[],"caption":""},{"id":471486,"name":"clikovs4a009m6jsz3jcbarvf_fearfactory-6027.webp","mime":"image/webp","url":"https://cdn.liketu.com/media/derangedvisions/images/clikovs4a009m6jsz3jcbarvf_fearfactory-6027/clikovs4a009m6jsz3jcbarvf_fearfactory-6027.webp","tags":[],"caption":""},{"id":471487,"name":"clikovumy008yaxsza0gq7cul_fearfactory-6028.webp","mime":"image/webp","url":"https://cdn.liketu.com/media/derangedvisions/images/clikovumy008yaxsza0gq7cul_fearfactory-6028/clikovumy008yaxsza0gq7cul_fearfactory-6028.webp","tags":[],"caption":""},{"id":471488,"name":"clikovww600b04zszdne42cb8_fearfactory-6030.webp","mime":"image/webp","url":"https://cdn.liketu.com/media/derangedvisions/images/clikovww600b04zszdne42cb8_fearfactory-6030/clikovww600b04zszdne42cb8_fearfactory-6030.webp","tags":[],"caption":""}]}},"payout":38.459,"replies":[],"created":"2023-06-06T19:44:18","community":"hive-194913","author_role":"admin","permlink":"haunted-pride","author":"derangedvisions","payout_at":"2023-06-13T19:44:18","author_payout_value":"0.000 HBD","is_paidout":false,"author_reputation":80.61,"url":"/hive-194913/@derangedvisions/haunted-pride","active_votes":null,"percent_hbd":10000,"blacklists":[],"title":"Haunted Pride ","post_id":124216334,"updated":"2023-06-06T19:44:18","category":"hive-194913","stats":{"hide":false,"gray":false,"total_votes":275,"flag_weight":0},"children":6},"nurfay/weekend-getaway-by-visiting-waterboom-taman-mangat-ceria":{"pending_payout_value":"45.082 HBD","curator_payout_value":"0.000 HBD","body":"&lt;div class=\"text-justify\"&gt; &lt;div class=\"pull-left\"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;\n\n![20230606_201014_0000.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/nurfay/48me23PzcEM82EknFHm2ZWhNdTQAgEYkqTEPZLwSTeCxHXL1XfW5tv2Xcw7HcVqzFM.jpg)\n&lt;hr&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;sub&gt;**Holidays are a way to make yourself happy with your family.

This place is a park as well as a water playground which is very popular in my area. Almost every day is never empty of visitors, various walks of life be it children, teenagers to adults. This place is a tourist destination that is liked by many people, even yesterday when I visited the elderly, they also enjoyed the beautiful charm of the water rides here.\n\n&lt;div class=\"pull-left\"&gt;\n\n![20230603_093941.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/nurfay/EptaTULP8hYhMcQnwDEztC9A1wTfLJwT5SyeRuJ6B82kmossdi9X8cg4EBYeH9UYgSx.jpg)\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=\"pull-left\"&gt;\n\n![20230603_093824.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/nurfay/EpNnubk8Egqen9TWbueUPxZeemd8Puiw1WZA5HPsWzQn2WRTzVLyarg8qWvLrp6Ahkk.jpg)\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;\n\nOne thing that makes me really like this place besides being clean and tidy, this place is very disciplined and always under the supervision of officers in every location.

Maybe there's no other reason, because I have busy nephews, so the spirit of getting them to a place like this is the main goal. Lots of changes have occurred in this place, from year to year. So that makes this place a place that you must visit if you are on vacation with your family.\n\nThis place was officially opened about 15 years ago, I remember very well when I was still in college in 2013 this place had become a popular tourist destination among us. This water playground is privately owned by one of the most well-known owners in the Blang Mangat Village area. Now the operational hours of this place are open every day from Monday to Sunday at 08.00 WIB closing at 18.00 WIB and the difference is only on Friday it is open from 14.00 to 18.00 WIB. For the entrance ticket fee per person, a tariff of IDR 25,000 is charged.\n\n![20230603_092754.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/nurfay/Eou9CED3hkd4MwWEdbZQbG5W5vUzCqgVQQz3LJ85R1hPuZbjF6HVa1mxrMbgxW63JJc.jpg)\n\n&lt;div class=\"pull-left\"&gt;\n\n![20230603_092832.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/nurfay/EoK5LPnHAHBHARFAE8MRabqkYTT5PGEQMWCWQBMd3T8bCRNAsuYAy7zpjx8reuopVHp.jpg)\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=\"pull-left\"&gt;\n\n![20230603_092836.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/nurfay/EogMufF34w7ZPmkk9zaHuNnrywin2rhZbzLZaW8r9vWEsc1Q39mBu8v3zA18MdctF1S.jpg)\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;\n\nAfter paying the entrance ticket, my nephew and I and my other relatives entered the Waterboom yard area. Our main goal is to find a comfortable seat to relax and store things. Entering the main area, we will be presented with a footpath area planted with green trees on either side, quite neat. But to enter the seating area we have to walk quite far inside, I highly recommend those of you who bring food from home like us to carry a push bag or suitcase to make it easier. \n\n![20230603_092903.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/nurfay/23w2sWAHD1PmBsNC9Q3iZNXBSSf7QQGoZott2h3fnW5W6W2t4bxg8saWjPQ8dupATYDMb.jpg)\n\nEntering inside, I did not forget to take some pictures of my nephew. At first they didn't want to, they were very enthusiastic and rushed to get in and play right away. And that moment was very funny in my opinion, just look at what we brought from home, there's a lot, isn't it?\n\n![20230603_093805.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/nurfay/23zkkLqtDvvFxecHwFSMVxgSRceG5ivTu8J3cKLLSCPwhevmvxjDez17kdMVq1wH7vQkK.jpg)\n\n&lt;div class=\"pull-left\"&gt;\n\n![20230603_093751.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/nurfay/EqFt32pYJhL2zXD3b3f17HGDYxwTMDdJ15LAj95pMbQ5GRpZR57Cx93An7Kyq4SCZaN.jpg)\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=\"pull-left\"&gt;\n\n![20230603_093758.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/nurfay/EqJ1rTKvLTWt88zYWhLCNmAYqdMP4FzK2zScUB5xu9aBGVF5BcWH8dtaTXMr6VXBbbz.jpg)\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;\n\nAfter my nephew changed his bathing uniform, we rushed straight to the pool area.

Now for the next pool is an adult pool with a depth of approximately 1 meter and a half.\n\n![20230603_093851.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/nurfay/EpQxEr8FemzH4UjqFCJFpLEoSbnkH5RU9zci71nGRrHwhR8qWozfsAcTkRbdxjers6K.jpg)\n\nThe children's play area is one of my and my family's favorite places. It's very comfortable here, we don't even need to worry if they play here, it's very safe. Apart from being very shallow, this place is also very cool because it is under the trees. and also there are umbrellas that block the sun from shining directly on our faces.\n\n&lt;div class=\"pull-left\"&gt;\n\n![20230603_100240.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/nurfay/EpQyCJyURid9WkMNyAZ48m8iAbrvXgCY4GgSDtYX6dJV4H2hPZy4QHYcubZphdG9muD.jpg)\n\n![20230603_100412.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/nurfay/EpJYdEV6WowY22ZxRTyxhLrKzATKZvBCAzn5CFod3xSTEDk3NmGks23ixSB1Dm5qjFK.jpg)\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=\"pull-left\"&gt;\n\n![20230603_100331.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/nurfay/EpGRBKJ5gXxoyxewxkgVgbmrcQH4cLpo9V8ot13uNujfxVMAWWAWTB7fHqbcMq7atqY.jpg)\n\n![20230603_100457.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/nurfay/23yTmHFPw8cizeG1MBSNtRicXKJiJPu7WHK2KEvhiCDH9ZGDzv4QiYYxi8nkJDomabqAx.jpg)\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;\n\nThe properties and supporting rides here are very complete, each pool has a slide according to the pool it is used for. I think the owner here really thought of a mature concept to build this area.\n\n![20230603_135714.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/nurfay/23z75XrW9x9zrbprYVNmJJvdoY7cZVR3RKRm4gvszxE4oUfN4kJc3KF9MVfV8cv9XkGbA.jpg)\n&lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;\n\nThe pool area is also surrounded by a pond like a river with a depth of more than one meter.

So here we take a paid place at a price of IDR. 20,000, so that our goods are safe and also a place for comfortable shelter. Well we brought kids and toddlers so had to think of a place to rest. Besides, we're not here for a while, but from morning to evening, well, the goal is to be satisfied playing. So for those of you who bring your family to a place like this, come early, the atmosphere is very calm and not crowded at all.

After my posts from my Japan trip, I want to take a break and come back to somewhere close. My home. \n\nI was born and raised here in Northern part of Thailand, in a province called Chiang Mai. And all around the city we have such chill vibe and nice food. You all know my favorite dish \"Noodle\". So, today I want to share one of my favorite noodle places here.\n\nBefore we get into the place, I want to do a quick brief about our noodle culture, so you guys can get a picture a little bit more.\nNoodle is the most common street food here in Thailand. In a bowl, you will get the noodle (of your choice), the vegetable (i.e. beansprout or morning glory), the soup (stock) and some protein (this ingredient is pretty much what would that noodle be called after)\n\n![LINE_ALBUM_food cnx_230606_21.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/nomnomnoodle/23tbyZNGCPXfCDEY2kFVdg8phsrkjAMi4tiXcgXohWFW9raJA1H2xPbyayP4g9KJfwc3K.jpg)\n\n\nSo the place is called \"Oil, Beef Noodle\", which means the protein part is Beef. and \"Oil\" is a name of the owner.\n\nThe ingredient of the Beef noodle usually depends on the places. The standard is having sliced beef, braised beef and the beef ball. I personally and especially love cow offal, which I completely understand that it's not for everybody. But if you're interested to see how it looks like, I promise it won't be scary. a little weird maybe, but assuredly friendly haha\n\nThis is how the dish looks like.\n![LINE_ALBUM_food cnx_230606_19.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/nomnomnoodle/23wgPzmEKrJV4EzJTNCFQsRfMgiQ1eqKtHXyBSoHpz5M4hdCu9GstuPCZDbb6W1rAh5uX.jpg)\nFor this one I picked Thin rice noodles, which are mostly little shy and hiding under the meat stuff on top of it. \n\n![LINE_ALBUM_food cnx_230606_11.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/nomnomnoodle/23wCJNCbkFHAkZMwZTC3QH8pS4Ae7gjkPbWCqDJiomrHquKVLYZXTLshj64b9udKSRZzz.jpg)\n\nNow I'm gonna go through the beef part and try to explain each of them.\nThis one is a piece of sliced Beef. To cook this one, you have to make sure that it's not overcooked, otherwise it'd be too hard to chew. Here they made it so thin and nicely cooked, so I love it.\n\n![LINE_ALBUM_food cnx_230606_2.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/nomnomnoodle/23tviXEbhdgmocUtrM5Yy5ho5N6DiWPTEzC2fiHsyGcXmGEWDuvumWYhGyPhn3sTxSKok.jpg)\n\nThis one is braised beef, which needs to be braised for many hours before hand until it soft, tender and flavorful. Some of the braised beef are full of fat, so they can look very different from one another.\n![LINE_ALBUM_foodcnx_230606_5.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/nomnomnoodle/23vsNEZc4pV5Y3iW7nAa9VDgqMfmsswT3uPiyZYJQxtP4F1DixrJ59f86GWF3t1p2GgRq.jpg)\n\nThis is cow intestine, sounds scary I know, but this one they made it so clean and soft and oh my god, such a joy to eat them.\n![LINE_ALBUM_food cnx_230606_7.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/nomnomnoodle/23xAY326Jf3VpgxJhoL3v1ApCiD5wkoVxVBsv4gGLgwCVhnDq1UhnFKpjtuP3abt32bww.jpg)\n\nThere's also some offal like liver and spleen that I unfortunately didn't take picture of, because I'm too hungry and eat them right away. \n![LINE_ALBUM_food cnx_230606_17.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/nomnomnoodle/23wCEJUbcJ12vq39Lj33gr3eMGPRCyir3PWTvdYhPpBZq2pCkuG4nHRYZvmonMpbXT4XJ.jpg)\n\nSo, overall this place is absolutely 10 out of 10. I can see how they put hard work and dedication in every detail of the dish. Even though it's street food. Everything is very nice and clean, located in the middle of the city, very easy to find and I will definitely come back again.\n\nIf you never try the beef noodle with these ingredients before, I highly recommend this place for you to check it out whenever you come to Chiang Mai. \n\nThat'd be my post for today. Thank you so much and I'll see you guys again soon!\n\nKhob khun kaa,\nNomnomnoodle \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","community_title":"Foodies Bee Hive","max_accepted_payout":"1000000.000 HBD","beneficiaries":[{"account":"hiveonboard","weight":100},{"account":"ocdb","weight":100},{"account":"peakd","weight":300}],"depth":0,"promoted":"0.000 HBD","author_title":"","net_rshares":149661240703286,"json_metadata":{"app":"peakd/2023.6.2","format":"markdown","tags":["nomnomfoodie","noodle","cnx","chiangmai","beefnoodle","streetfood","thailand"],"users":[],"image":["https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/nomnomnoodle/23tbyZNGCPXfCDEY2kFVdg8phsrkjAMi4tiXcgXohWFW9raJA1H2xPbyayP4g9KJfwc3K.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/nomnomnoodle/23wgPzmEKrJV4EzJTNCFQsRfMgiQ1eqKtHXyBSoHpz5M4hdCu9GstuPCZDbb6W1rAh5uX.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/nomnomnoodle/23wCJNCbkFHAkZMwZTC3QH8pS4Ae7gjkPbWCqDJiomrHquKVLYZXTLshj64b9udKSRZzz.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/nomnomnoodle/23tviXEbhdgmocUtrM5Yy5ho5N6DiWPTEzC2fiHsyGcXmGEWDuvumWYhGyPhn3sTxSKok.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/nomnomnoodle/23vsNEZc4pV5Y3iW7nAa9VDgqMfmsswT3uPiyZYJQxtP4F1DixrJ59f86GWF3t1p2GgRq.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/nomnomnoodle/23xAY326Jf3VpgxJhoL3v1ApCiD5wkoVxVBsv4gGLgwCVhnDq1UhnFKpjtuP3abt32bww.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/nomnomnoodle/23wCEJUbcJ12vq39Lj33gr3eMGPRCyir3PWTvdYhPpBZq2pCkuG4nHRYZvmonMpbXT4XJ.jpg"]},"payout":70.308,"replies":[],"created":"2023-06-06T05:40:09","community":"hive-120586","author_role":"guest","permlink":"try-beef-noooodle-with-me-in-chiang-mai","author":"nomnomnoodle","payout_at":"2023-06-13T05:40:09","author_payout_value":"0.000 HBD","is_paidout":false,"author_reputation":64.89,"url":"/hive-120586/@nomnomnoodle/try-beef-noooodle-with-me-in-chiang-mai","active_votes":null,"percent_hbd":10000,"blacklists":[],"title":"Try Beef Noooodle with me in Chiang Mai","post_id":124200177,"updated":"2023-06-06T05:40:09","category":"hive-120586","stats":{"hide":false,"gray":false,"total_votes":304,"flag_weight":0},"children":3},"olga.maslievich/kayakoey-ghost-town-fresh-wind-of-my-thelongesttrip":{"pending_payout_value":"36.789 HBD","curator_payout_value":"0.000 HBD","body":"![IMG_20230605_153810.jpg](https://images.hive.blog/DQmRdt8675tPzisKgcPBSP4NAwQWMxfsFqBE5tvX1GzwzyS/IMG_20230605_153810.jpg)\n\n***The city ghost...

But after a month of living in one place, I'm dreaming about the next trip again :)\nWhen I planned my trip from Kemer to Cesme, I looked at all the interesting places on my way.  I was attracted to this mysterious place and visited it on the way back.\nOnce a thriving settlement, its ancient stone buildings now stand in eerie silence, witnesses to a forgotten past.\nWe set out from the city of Fethiye on steep serpentines through the mountains and stopping on the roadside we saw a mysterious abandoned city in the distance, which was really like a ghost.\n\n![IMG_20230603_201547.jpg](https://images.hive.blog/DQmYv3dnULdLCs3bJsmJ5nVVKaDiRx4eTVtPNBUj6piPw9y/IMG_20230603_201547.jpg)\n\n![IMG_20230603_202125.jpg](https://images.hive.blog/DQmScaR12m8Q6ebxxFinjp8jsWLWE4jN3Ci8Pq2N5nR2Cyp/IMG_20230603_202125.jpg)\n\nWe drove up to the Lebessos restaurant.  We drank tea with pancakes.  The restaurant is very popular and really has a nice design in an ancient style.\nImmediately outside the restaurant, there is only one house by the road that shows signs of life.  Respectable old-timers have their own small businesses here.  They sell a variety of folk crafts, carpets and antiques to tourists.  Next we saw the entrance fee, but we were able to visit the Koyakoi Open Air Museum for free using our museum cards.\n\n![IMG_20230603_202042.jpg](https://images.hive.blog/DQmWRQUeZRNSoRnyxKS2JxiHZD5q1W8GE3SNdqeUBrAA45Y/IMG_20230603_202042.jpg)\n\n[//]:# (!pinmapple 36.57327 lat 29.08765 long  d3scr)\n\n![IMG_20230603_202002.jpg](https://images.hive.blog/DQmbP4JEtYkDbAYY8tMeUZSQ9kbboza5n9MGVW1MvsCnnP7/IMG_20230603_202002.jpg)\n\n![IMG_20230603_201406.jpg](https://images.hive.blog/DQmWCaXBoP98F4CWKq5eLwkyjJwXcbjMQ9tH7N5bA7KmgHe/IMG_20230603_201406.jpg)\n\nCenturies ago, Koiakoi was a vital trading post on the ancient Lycian trade routes and the city flourished under the influence of different cultures. The strategic location of the city provided it with prosperity and power.\nHowever, some historical events and natural phenomena took place in Koyakoy, a gradual decline took place... People left the city and its prosperous streets were slowly conquered by nature... We slowly climbed the quiet deserted streets on stone cobblestones, which testified to the past strength and wealth of this ancient city.  Poppies and daisies were blooming all around, which further emphasized the beauty of this lonely place.  \n\n![IMG_20230603_201304.jpg](https://images.hive.blog/DQmPJdQrXfyLwXLMK9RDUw1GrbQMpvVd7qxquQ1HXiZRL54/IMG_20230603_201304.jpg)\n\n![IMG_20230603_200933.jpg](https://images.hive.blog/DQmbHAskpTvMJfff87EPs5ghZPaZbCAcVDwkjFPnKPVyYxy/IMG_20230603_200933.jpg)\n\nOnly a herd of sheep that grazed near the houses made this city alive.\nWe wandered leisurely through the narrow lanes, feeling a connection with a long-gone world, among crumbling stone abandoned houses, trying to imagine the life that once existed within their walls...thinking about the impermanence of civilizations and the inexorable flow of time...\n\n![IMG_20230605_154604.jpg](https://images.hive.blog/DQmbztkVqhBHE48DDbXKRK5Q1GDpLh34Z8eRxoRSoxPRvmf/IMG_20230605_154604.jpg)\n\n![IMG_20230603_201047.jpg](https://images.hive.blog/DQmcfLvLFUUdsHAuH3mgFBS87WzgBipPVWi1B5iMfoW7CF9/IMG_20230603_201047.jpg)\n\nKayaköy was founded on solid ground.  The buildings are located in such a way that they do not block each other's light\n When you reach the top, you will see a wide square.  The Upper Church, one of Kayaköy's two great churches, is located here.  The church has long been closed, walk down the road from here to see the buildings on the other side of the village.  Along the way you come across empty houses with broken roofs and windows.  Fires inside houses, chimneys once smoke.  Now it's all gone, it's a dream...\n\n![IMG_20230603_200829.jpg](https://images.hive.blog/DQmRUeN77LGzZAK8FrVmkwNoWdhLBHaMYHxrg4UxGYtLWik/IMG_20230603_200829.jpg)\n\n![IMG_20230603_201509.jpg](https://images.hive.blog/DQmQG9U1tGE11RGgkduP55EULsPynHQeJQ3cpeQ9ytAP9aN/IMG_20230603_201509.jpg)\n\nKayaköy is like a big open-air museum.\n This walk takes me back in time... I wonder how they lived, what kind of people lived in this house?  I wonder what the women who came to the fountain that day to get water were talking about?  And what about the children who were playing outside?  What did they dream about...\n\n![IMG_20230603_201758.jpg](https://images.hive.blog/DQmZQ1weE5GfJWY2EaH3qvgfirPW5bkG3iZywUmJ5aFfUjj/IMG_20230603_201758.jpg)\n\n![IMG_20230603_200622.jpg](https://images.hive.blog/DQmRnYecrN59isf8ie3n1BQ2EKs1ixSCTVxbpAkXHbqnVDX/IMG_20230603_200622.jpg)\n\nOf course, [I found a lot of information about this village](https://www.rehbername.com/seyahat/kayakoy-gezi-rehberi), which has extremely ancient roots and a rich history.\nAlthough Levisi is said to have been founded in the 19th century, if you look at historical sources, there is a contradiction here.  Because in the early Ottoman period Greek and Turkish life are mentioned here.  At the beginning of the 20th century, it experienced its richest and most active days.\n The village of Levisi, which was founded further down the slopes, was a small village that was originally made up exclusively of Greeks.  Over time, Levissi shows the characteristics of a city, not a village.  Its population is increasing, people engage in agriculture and receive migration from surrounding villages.  They say that at that time there was a population of 10 thousand.\n Education continues in the schools established in Leviss, health care improves, and they open their own pharmacies.  The first printing house in the region was created here, the first newspaper is printed here.  There were 2 large churches and many chapels in the village.  The Orthodox Greek population was engaged in agriculture, crafts and trade, and experienced the greatest prosperity.\n\n![IMG_20230603_200449.jpg](https://images.hive.blog/DQmPDRmZzMdV4uEkypryeQTSrpFFwRyKFrdEQjWcLRxhg4R/IMG_20230603_200449.jpg)\n\n![IMG_20230603_194610.jpg](https://images.hive.blog/DQmfMtfMFjdDzV85mVPZuYDwDhbicC44b1YDmVtGww8mPRW/IMG_20230603_194610.jpg)\n\n After the victory in the Turkish War of Independence, an unprecedented agreement was concluded between Greece and Turkey.  Exchange signed January 30, 1923;  It came to the fore as a replacement for Muslims and Christians based on the criterion of religion.  As a result of the exchange, thousands of Christian Greeks and Turks immigrated to Greece.  Many Muslims from Greece were forced to move to Anatolia.\nPeople who were said to have moved from here initially thought they would leave for a short time and come back again. Therefore, leaving the village, they entrusted their belongings to their Turkish neighbors, and left the village with a suitcase. For those who left, there was no return, and people from Greece were brought to this evacuated village...\n\n![IMG_20230603_201153.jpg](https://images.hive.blog/DQmPXje2TK3tP4TF7zNzcycAdJVUsLLmMkmVWnDysEcuFmW/IMG_20230603_201153.jpg)\n\nToday, this place, which survived even the 1957 Fethiye earthquake, is struggling to resist the roots of fig trees that are destroying houses... Fig trees are doing their last duty after lives that have ended and lives that have died...\n\n![IMG_20230603_202455.jpg](https://images.hive.blog/DQmZYtJNJ5Qej7RuNvBN7s1wSR4gABL4cEza6M1WH9QkrnP/IMG_20230603_202455.jpg)\n\n![IMG_20230605_004402.jpg](https://images.hive.blog/DQmPD3ebrUjAq9knmXvyvvqnSqZZFmr1v42MKp8zU47JTiC/IMG_20230605_004402.jpg)\n\nMy daughters were tired from the long walk in the city, which was located in the mountains and sat down to rest, but I was eager to climb up to the very last houses to see the view of the city of Koyakoy from the top.\n When I got up and stopped at the last house, the sun was already setting over the city, casting a golden hue on its worn stones.  Unbelievable delight and excitement came over me, feeling this silent spirit of past centuries...\n I made a video to commemorate our visit to this unique ghost town.\n  Although the city is abandoned and forgotten, its legacy remains, capturing the hearts of those who seek its hidden stories and legends.\n  Koyakoi stands as a silent guardian of a bygone era, forcing us to think about the transience of life and the value of today's moment...\n\nhttps://youtu.be/IviwjGWUTb4\n\n![IMG_20230603_202308.jpg](https://images.hive.blog/DQmcXnHLAw4NdBSecAd36L6WJTf9byNTfPH4p7ndKZzFkXp/IMG_20230603_202308.jpg)\n\n***And we continue to be on our #TheLongestTrip.

From mountains to marine life to concrete jungles, and to laid-back islands. I have been to Cebu for over 10 years and every time I want to take a break from stress in life, there is this one island on the northernmost part of the province that would pop into my mind.\n\n\n![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/iamcjestrada/23vsWvjugzmCm8vmoBu1bmar1c5rPs8RLEAcbNKgwCTpSgXu9k41bs2G56D31NemeB8wD.png)\n\n\n**MALAPASCUA** - is a small island located at Daanbantayan, Cebu. It takes 4-5 hours to travel by land from the city center, and about 30 minutes boat ride to the island. The island is best known for scuba divers, especially for those who would like to see and get mindblown by the great thresher sharks. As much as I would like, I'm not a scuba diver and it's difficult for a freediver to reach the sharks since they can be found 30 meters deep. Hence, I am writing this blog to share with you what you can do in Malapscua even if you are not a scuba diver.\n\n### Things to do in Malapascua even if you are not a Scuba Diver\n\nHere are a few things and activities that you would not miss when visiting Malapscua Island especially if you are not a scuba diver.\n\n#### Visit Langub Beach\n\n\n![IMG_9881.JPG](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/iamcjestrada/243M9WrGLmz6CRsfUkDLmyivVc9xByM5YVWQmkEwMLFr4xH1LWAomWNgnoiXzEwfHypr2.JPG)\n\n\n**Langub Beach** is situated in the northernmost part of Malapscua Island. It features a long stretch of a white sand powder beach and turquoise sea water. It is perfect for just chilling, taking a cold beer, or even frolicking with your friends and family. Even you can go to the edge of the beach and reflect.\n\n&lt;div class=\"pull-left\"&gt;\n\n![IMG_9874.JPG](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/iamcjestrada/23y96R1V9eKcrw7o5QR5CTSiX1a9rzcjdG9GqgGU9jTKP5V6Ud6LyZnGAs4ududbuXmPA.JPG)\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"pull-right\"&gt;\n\n![IMG_9875.JPG](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/iamcjestrada/23yToN9KSYCgppJVqiMHgSatBPw2XfdkRqhxoXNqTW6mMwSBp7erv2uB9s6DSFyDMUULY.JPG)\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n![IMG_9873.JPG](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/iamcjestrada/23ynhCPuPG1LUfdhUpp4bw7ZmG2PP8RrRXZST8CGMzqJHuQgEWrE5u8rLHD3p7aGuaqBh.JPG)\n\n\n\nIt takes 30 minutes to walk from the Poblacion of Malapascua, while it may take just 5-10 minutes to ride a motorcycle taxi for P40 (0.71 USD). Whichever you take, is an experience for sure.\n \n#### Stroll at Logon Beach\n\n&lt;div class=\"pull-left\"&gt;\n\n![IMG_9878.JPG](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/iamcjestrada/242Nv5XvpmCY4eFaGbYKoawHtCiPHa7JVMrr4mNMntjtq1XzV4KRGbLJ4ypUbyp6kFom7.JPG)\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"pull-right\"&gt;\n\n![IMG_9876.JPG](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/iamcjestrada/241tn62P5zBRLyF7kuzcCaYpaoqtBJ53WqgtBHt6SMCKcEMDYuy6DC3J53UgPAPPUNYrx.JPG)\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n**Logon Beach** is located on the west side of Malapascua Island, and it's at the island's poblacion. It has a white sand beach, but it's not as powdery as Langub Beach. While I was strolling, I was surprised that there were a lot of establishments, restaurants, and shops located there. If you are looking for someplace to chill and dine while at the beachfront, Logon Beach is a place to go.\n\n#### Take a Dip at the Bounty Beach\n\n&lt;div class=\"pull-left\"&gt;\n\n![IMG_9883.JPG](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/iamcjestrada/23yThHGPpf2SQv5L8uA3bvJySQ3FpukgfaY7u1oG1NbKguoTpRoXsR4RG6bSZrNRk6PuT.JPG)\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"pull-right\"&gt;\n\n![IMG_9888.JPG](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/iamcjestrada/23ywqQWnKf4WtWv1rLGsBzKkGiLmd9khBJejJGKyt3KdiQ4ia1pwzAB85MhRMEco2BHBM.JPG)\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"pull-left\"&gt;\n\n![IMG_9880.JPG](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/iamcjestrada/2432U7HJT26PJgUP48McdsSSVge3sE57s5gzhrDK91NhMHJcKTyeiyYgeaTXucmndpofN.JPG)\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"pull-right\"&gt;\n\n![IMG_9879.JPG](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/iamcjestrada/242DZV8svGTsy96SqZ8fJHfPTnoKHVMH4dtUg1aQewgYzeMHLVCwqQLJ6fYoQFUJzzERN.JPG)\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nIf you are looking for a secluded place and a beach away from the crowd, then Bounty Beach is for you. Bounty Beach is located on the southeast side of the island. It features powdery white sand and shallow turquoise water.  There are resorts along the beach which I think are the expensive ones. There are a lot of fishing boats around so I guess this is where most of the locals dock it when they're not fishing. Nevertheless, you can still take a dip, and enjoy at the beach.\n\n#### Rent a Boat for an Island Tour\n\n\n![IMG_9891.JPG](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/iamcjestrada/Eou9feyhTqVxZJL4SSDgD7dz6YAu9BZWo7U4jJwS9wSQqKAP7hxw289US38XmZ7yVKD.JPG)\n\nMalapscua Island features multiple spots around the island. Hence, renting a boat and doing an island tour going around the island is a great way to spend your vacation. We paid P2,250 (40 USD) for a boat that accommodated 15 people. These are the spots that you will be visiting:\n\n##### Coral Garden\n\n![37482355356_cacb0bcb48_o.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/iamcjestrada/23ymbV2DCxk6G8opK2WhJaRFmSRHL8jRzMHGtsfGapfBpfiT1YPJcmadi5mbjthNJvHUF.jpg)\n*[Taken last 2017 and have already posted on my personal blog](https://iamcjestrada.wordpress.com/2017/10/06/malapascua-island/)*\n\nThe coral garden has a wide area of beautiful and rich corals. You can jump and dive, and be amazed by the natural beauty of the marine life.\n\n\n##### Ship Wreck\n\n&lt;a data-flickr-embed=\"true\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/147522435@N05/36820467594/in/photostream/\" title=\"Malapascua\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/4511/36820467594_1e28bdb9e7_h.jpg\" width=\"1334\" height=\"750\" alt=\"Malapascua\"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n*[Taken last 2017 and have already posted on my personal blog](https://iamcjestrada.wordpress.com/2017/10/06/malapascua-island/)*\n\nAnother spot to visit is the Ship Wreck which was told to have sunk during World War II. It is also a great spot for freediving (although when we visited, I wasn't a freediver yet HAHA).\n\n\nLastly, you may also ask the boatman for a pitstop at Langub Beach and enjoy the sunset. It's a great way to enjoy and boost your serotonin especially if you are in a group!\n\n#### Jump-Off for an Island Hopping to Carnaza Island, La Manok Island, or Kalanggaman Island\n\n&lt;div class=\"pull-left\"&gt;\n\n![IMG_9890.JPG](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/iamcjestrada/EpvhNUhWpaD6km3TYj52LEH1CGxJiNozRjgWkiFCCgbmfJAr1VwPHi633ztZvpa226N.JPG)\n*Carnaza Island*\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=\"pull-right\"&gt;\n\n![IMG_9893.JPG](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/iamcjestrada/23xVEnh1mSyjEzVhZA7Uekc8JnZvreVFu8KGua6FQKWgQ2DknbDZFWKLJZiEpeNkCaGDN.JPG)\n*Kalanggaman Island*\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n![IMG_9892.JPG](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/iamcjestrada/23sUCfCHCTUP9W6kVFo6N5CKvcfrPXtxFhh1mMSLfhkVbM8jLM2TBtHjrDXamBpAu358U.JPG)\n*La Manok Island*\n\n\nDue to its location, Malapascua is well-known as a jump-off to other distant islands such as Carnaza Island, La Manok Island (technically part of Masbate), and Kalanggaman Island (part of Leyte). Visiting there entails different costs. On our end, we had a tour of Carnaza Island and La Manok Island and a different tour of Kalanggaman Island. These tours were done on a different date though LOL!\n\n\n#### Night Life at Malapscua\n\nBelieve it or not, I haven't tried getting wasted at Malapascua. However, I have heard from my friends that the nightlife there is amazing. There are a lot of friendly locals and foreigners enjoying some booze. Here's a photo of me trying to be a nomad while others are having a party on another part of the island. LOL!\n\n\n![IMG_7666.JPG](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/iamcjestrada/23vsKytQty7CiouJz1eceoakCBtwWzN817ohTj36Tvqsdy2bL8G8s6gTHLuzm3akV2ofR.JPG)\n\n\nThere is indeed so much to do in Malapscua Island depending on your objectives, group of friends, schedule, and of course, budget. Visiting here could be expensive since supplies of the establishments have to be transported from mainland Cebu. Not to mention that their electricity is also generated by a power generator. With all of these accounted for, I think Malapscua Island is a place you should visit in Cebu. It is a great place to spend some time with your friends and family to reset, and even spend a few weeks as a nomad, and enjoy a laid-back life.\n\nI think that's it for today. See you in my next post, Hiveans!\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"pull-left\"&gt;\n&lt;img src=\"https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/iamcjestrada/EpXJzfSq6qEhUKHwD6QRdpcytz6Lm8hJcdHBZuwjiRNJbRHvYAcsT4EotnuqNvtY524.JPG\" alt=\"34766340-06D6-42E8-BE74-6FFF277B8098.JPG\"&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"pull-right\"&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHOR&lt;/h4&gt;\n\nHi, I am CJ Estrada!

The weather was quite rainy but as usual that did not stop us.

You can see the forest in the photo above with the teak being the ones with the lighter green leaves. The Natural forest resumes just after before reaching the beach entrance itself. It is quite beautiful and serene driving through this part as well, almost like a hug from nature!\n\n![Screenshot 2023-06-06 at 10.31.44 AM.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/lemniscate/23uQrSNVkc4CMRm1PMdxUwXaGhWkD3agFu6Ytzs9fjyQfyvKFFwUGRYgZFhQMBpjCR7z8.jpg)\n\nThe beach facility is not much with a main large yellow building that rises solitarily amidst a relatively small carpark. There are small stalls for vendors and the yellow building is a base of sorts for the life guards stationed there are the beach is so remote! \n\n![Screenshot 2023-06-06 at 10.28.07 AM.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/lemniscate/23ynWg7AYGXLHtjQpQC7fmLwFj21F3uRSywXXcrS2ruQWLDFWnYhLoqUkyUbEmTZz7ecH.jpg)\n\nThe beach was mostly still quite empty with the people who were already there being scattered throughout the expanse of the beach itself.  Life guards were in their towers monitoring those few bathers as well the hobbyist fishermen. I sent up the drone to do some exploring and to see what I could discover in this seldom frequented beach to share with my fellow countrymen who would be glad to appreciate their robust island even more.\n\n![Screenshot 2023-06-06 at 10.29.56 AM.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/lemniscate/23zbMU4Fz2LPjkgJbB2epHAohFgwji7c8QaWiFnnV7Q6FakU8qgJeN9HN6osstTCP228P.jpg)\n\nI started with the right side of the beach first which had basically just two families bathing at the time with their children. It is quite underdeveloped compared to the other beaches on the island, lacking beach chairs, umbrellas and the sort you would expect on the sands.\n\n![Screenshot 2023-06-06 at 10.30.18 AM.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/lemniscate/23ywuRDWPUkAjxq1naUcYF9Z254ZK6KxR7pdiEvdzbV4apoqKU5DHuCQVJ5Q41ZZJwB37.jpg)\n\nThere were, though, rocks that were put along the coastline to avoid further erosion of the hills and cliffs. Apparently, a few years ago, the beach was closed down to the public to perform these preventative measures and combat the erosion that had taken place over the years.\n\n![Screenshot 2023-06-06 at 10.30.43 AM.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/lemniscate/23uFejpdyWGZt2szUktqeY8A7h9s17i96xGsHBw2Jaj8AHVNizExc47V5Uq1dnsDkaCBF.jpg)\n\nHere you can see a family bathing and having fun and one would at the beach! The waters seemed quite muddy today with the rain and all and I wondered how they were feeling in the cool rainy weather. The sun seemed to be coming out soon and thats when I would rather bathe, with some warmth in the air. I hate to be cold and wet at the same time!\n\n![Screenshot 2023-06-06 at 10.22.01 AM.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/lemniscate/23wqeRVgrQycJnwFKycQ3y9TzckUT4nnyzb1VBcav92L93tdXLUbHgTZQtWyb8oh8nEuY.jpg)\n\nI continued along the coastline on this side for just a few minutes to see what I could find and I was definitely not disappointed! There were these cliff faces that were induced by coastal erosion and they looked so beautiful giving character and texture to what otherwise might have been a monotonous coastline!\n\n![Screenshot 2023-06-06 at 10.31.14 AM.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/lemniscate/23ynNEN5A4gAbSWkQV6WxfafssLLAeR1KDgrQiABghz9YizWs78xEJFnjTvoR8LpifR9K.jpg)\n\nI flew outwards away from the coastline to get a wider angle view and again I was not at all disappointed. It was quite fascinating to see the southern coastline that is literally the bottom of the island of Trinidad on such a larger scale other than on a map!\n\n![Screenshot 2023-06-06 at 10.28.34 AM.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/lemniscate/23vsSN89pKUDcdgtehoELk9jPBwBmyr5w3rFsdhRwkYem9DpgMyWry28fvnJ1yzRbe1EV.jpg)\n\nI tackled the right side of the beach next which had a lot more people on this side who seemed to be doing their religious rituals as well as the others who were fishing for hobbyist reasons. There were not fisherfolk here who fish for a living as you can see by lack of pirogues or fibre glass boats. You cans see the flags above that are used in the Hindu ritual prayers.\n\n![Screenshot 2023-06-06 at 10.24.44 AM.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/lemniscate/23wCA1HJr4LKqxd3hr3GooTzbfbh6XfpkSR2JdGrkogQJFY3LhLCPJ5XfLnwCmxxoTCN9.jpg)\n\nFurther along, the beach is terminated by this huge cliff face that also seemed to be formed by the erosion of the unrelenting ocean. It looked so breathtaking as well with its size compared to the other ones on the other side of the coastline.\n\n![Screenshot 2023-06-06 at 10.26.05 AM.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/lemniscate/23y8t1n36CwbwfP6BYhBQDuPYqNuXby7R8FH3xaYbKAduoqi7GePcf7fgJF7Gso5Jk5v8.jpg)\n\nThe erosion continued along this side for a while as well, these being more severed and dramatic in nature. It seemed that the earth itself could crumble and fall at any moment in time bringing the flora and fauna that it supports above it down into the sea with it.\n\n![Screenshot 2023-06-06 at 10.26.35 AM.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/lemniscate/23x16ojKfEfQRdXjV9a57z7RsTwGrwFXiaLirAy7oDQAzYa8zPAn7KPxYHpkQvHVyhnKF.jpg)\n\nHere is a top down shot of where the beach terminates at the said cliff face. You can get a fell who how calm the waters were as well as a better view of how dirty they were as well. Still, there were quite a lot of color left even though it was muddy as well as dingy and rainy.\n\n![Screenshot 2023-06-06 at 10.29.11 AM.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/lemniscate/23y8qjfkKgoYKgWAho27VY46eMPSFYkEhjMAx6c2wre1PgdoUfSQgByNQJ9zdeU4iCmMS.jpg)\n\nI could not resist taking a few more shots of the cliff face from a lower angle itself to get a feel for the scale and height of ti amidst the waves. You can get a sense of scale with the little specks of fishermen in throwing lines in the water above.\n\n![Screenshot 2023-06-06 at 10.27.25 AM.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/lemniscate/23ywuihmnM65hgsK7KmYJJ67mC1mU9JxbCLBryfRiip6WyrGuPFDTUwYGcbBx1NNPVAzL.jpg)\n\nSpeaking of fisher men, the ones who come with their expensive fishing rods and reels and gear were out in their numbers today as it was a national holiday. Some were submerged in the water as you may see above just throwing their lines and doing what they love best! I need to get into fishing, it looks so relaxing!\n\n![Screenshot 2023-06-06 at 10.29.40 AM.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/lemniscate/23yThZdBQFj7oXASoBmPDHUdFKUG7GatBvNFM7uSSRVS46bNgnyL6RqxE2nHB5eX5cauE.jpg)\n\nI wanted to ask how the fish were biting today but I was kind of scared to disrupt their intense concentration on what they were indulging in. It made me want to join their hobby even more! Some were also on the shoreline as well with a rod holder stuck in the sand and they tended to it one in a while.\n\n![Screenshot 2023-06-06 at 10.32.06 AM.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/lemniscate/23tbyGwQbc4es9aAYxsJc1a33KCgFCFwVeN1ruWtmEkueUCtFTbCTu2EYGkTNM7eiaAWw.jpg)\n\nQuinam Beach was quite the adventure that day with all of the unseen discoveries for me. Not many people in Trinidad would have been able to get such an aerial wide angle glimpse of what Quinam truly looks like and I was quite glad to have documented it along with the people who were there that day to enjoy all that it had to offer! Thanks a lot for coming along, Cheers!\n\n[//]:# (!pinmapple 10.07285 lat -61.50839 long Quinam Beach d3scr)","community_title":"Pinmapple","max_accepted_payout":"1000000.000 HBD","beneficiaries":[],"depth":0,"promoted":"0.000 HBD","author_title":"","net_rshares":85365733475069,"json_metadata":{"app":"peakd/2023.6.2","format":"markdown","description":"We explore Quinam Beach to find views that were never before seen in Trinidad!","tags":["beach","island","exploration","life","travel","famous"],"users":[],"image":["https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/lemniscate/23y8jQr6WNQnXfY3MujaRu4ZfV9Kv46KcgnahnyYJfcoBxf4cgbo7WSTDD5H85dzaRQxM.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/lemniscate/23ywm2MpMkXMjC9aXGG8txR9s1HBXhdsTVZKpVVAKvdTmhdSPhs2ToQN3F9MzYgFD3gbe.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/lemniscate/23uQrSNVkc4CMRm1PMdxUwXaGhWkD3agFu6Ytzs9fjyQfyvKFFwUGRYgZFhQMBpjCR7z8.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/lemniscate/23ynWg7AYGXLHtjQpQC7fmLwFj21F3uRSywXXcrS2ruQWLDFWnYhLoqUkyUbEmTZz7ecH.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/lemniscate/23zbMU4Fz2LPjkgJbB2epHAohFgwji7c8QaWiFnnV7Q6FakU8qgJeN9HN6osstTCP228P.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/lemniscate/23ywuRDWPUkAjxq1naUcYF9Z254ZK6KxR7pdiEvdzbV4apoqKU5DHuCQVJ5Q41ZZJwB37.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/lemniscate/23uFejpdyWGZt2szUktqeY8A7h9s17i96xGsHBw2Jaj8AHVNizExc47V5Uq1dnsDkaCBF.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/lemniscate/23wqeRVgrQycJnwFKycQ3y9TzckUT4nnyzb1VBcav92L93tdXLUbHgTZQtWyb8oh8nEuY.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/lemniscate/23ynNEN5A4gAbSWkQV6WxfafssLLAeR1KDgrQiABghz9YizWs78xEJFnjTvoR8LpifR9K.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/lemniscate/23vsSN89pKUDcdgtehoELk9jPBwBmyr5w3rFsdhRwkYem9DpgMyWry28fvnJ1yzRbe1EV.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/lemniscate/23wCA1HJr4LKqxd3hr3GooTzbfbh6XfpkSR2JdGrkogQJFY3LhLCPJ5XfLnwCmxxoTCN9.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/lemniscate/23y8t1n36CwbwfP6BYhBQDuPYqNuXby7R8FH3xaYbKAduoqi7GePcf7fgJF7Gso5Jk5v8.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/lemniscate/23x16ojKfEfQRdXjV9a57z7RsTwGrwFXiaLirAy7oDQAzYa8zPAn7KPxYHpkQvHVyhnKF.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/lemniscate/23y8qjfkKgoYKgWAho27VY46eMPSFYkEhjMAx6c2wre1PgdoUfSQgByNQJ9zdeU4iCmMS.jpg","https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/lemniscate/23ywuihmnM65hgsK7KmYJJ67mC1mU9JxbCLBryfRiip6WyrGuPFDTUwYGcbBx1NNPVAzL.jpg"]},"payout":40.087,"replies":[],"created":"2023-06-06T15:44:54","community":"hive-163772","author_role":"guest","permlink":"exploring-quinam-beach-on-the-southernmost-coastline-of-trinidad","author":"lemniscate","payout_at":"2023-06-13T15:44:54","author_payout_value":"0.000 HBD","is_paidout":false,"author_reputation":70.52,"url":"/hive-163772/@lemniscate/exploring-quinam-beach-on-the-southernmost-coastline-of-trinidad","active_votes":null,"percent_hbd":10000,"blacklists":[],"title":"Exploring Quinam Beach on the Southernmost Coastline of Trinidad!","post_id":124210680,"updated":"2023-06-06T15:44:54","category":"hive-163772","stats":{"hide":false,"gray":false,"total_votes":960,"flag_weight":0},"children":8},"livinguktaiwan/postcards-from-europe-and-beyond":{"pending_payout_value":"42.689 HBD","curator_payout_value":"0.000 HBD","body":"It's been nearly two months since I did an update on [my postcard experiment](https://peakd.com/hive-122221/@livinguktaiwan/hive-is-all-about-engagement-and-answers-to-april-hpud-guessing-contest). Sadly there's still no news on a bunch of postcards that I sent out nearly three months ago.  Not that I'm counting every day, but this is how long it's been since I sent out 8 postcards to the following 6 countries. One can only wait and hope they will arrive .....  one day\n\nPhilippines, Pakistan and South Africa - **89** days\nChile - **85** days\nCuba and Venezuela - **80** days\n\n---\n\nOn a much brighter note, I received some postcards from some friends who agreed to take part in my little experiment.  Let me show you the lovely selection\n\n![20230605_095846.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/livinguktaiwan/Eoc9PjUaaw3QRk4LxDxaPLJYyJhLiibbu2KqJT7fC83hxbgYvZcf9qpxay8yTxY6hTQ.jpg)\n\n### Dozza, Italy\n\nThis one was sent to me from @delilhavores in Italy.  She's from Bologna and the postcard is a medieval village called Dozza near where she lives.  The villages is famous for the murals painted around the buildings as seen from the postcard, and this is confirmed by the one and only [post](https://peakd.com/hive-163772/@miljo76/dozza-the-colourful-open-air) that was pinned on Pinmapple last year by miljo76.  Now I fully understand why she said this is a breathtaking place.\n![20230605_095954.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/livinguktaiwan/23xL57DJbKRE5rTB3BKG9qdAfnSMbBS77os8ZGQM2i8gnzCF9EDZqbp1LGFQtdbP5cTGs.jpg)\n\nThe stamp on the postcard is of Ruggiero Leoncavallo.  I have to confess, I have no idea who this person is. And that is the beauty of these interactions, because it gives me the opportunity to learn about random things from around the world.  It turns out that Leoncavallo is a famous Italian composer and his most famous piece of work is Pagliacci.  Naturally, I had to google that, and found a performance by [Luciano Pavarotti](https://youtu.be/G1XkhDU8Y9E) which is less than 3 minutes long.  So much emotion in his performance!  This postcard was  sent on 31st March and it arrived when I was away in April, so it took between 2 to 4 weeks to arrive from Italy to UK.\n\n![20230605_100010.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/livinguktaiwan/Ep5p8McCRHM2NBUEwqxgx7H8uR1Jss7n2xjTHeTEb2cEXNJACmRMgT8ohEJMwnM8yiN.jpg)\n\n---\n### Sintra, Portugal\nHere's another postcard I received when I was away in April.  @pardinus sent this to me and is about a place called Sintra.  It looks very pretty, and we hae a lot of pins on Pinmapple here.  Seems like it is easily accessible from Lisbon as a day trip, I shall bear that in mind if I ever go to Lisbon again as it's nice to travel beyond the big cities sometimes.\n![20230605_100025.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/livinguktaiwan/23y8xRCH8e9bqy4vAVq2ef4KygLvEjSTTNu2PPrVfWGLG8msNAusdocWCCsuSc8rdJLkr.jpg)\n\nOriginally I thought the stamp was of a baguette, but that's French and this is Portugal so I can't be a baguette.  I googled Travesseiro de Sintra and struck gold!!!  Turns out travesseiro means cushion/pillow and this is a famous local delicacy made of puff pastry, egg yolks, almonds and sugar.  Desserts are absolutely my favourite, another reason to go to Sintra on my next visit to Portugal!!!\n![20230605_100038.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/livinguktaiwan/Ep3gJiXUMMxVPiu4MGZcBJwsjNC3e217gPFfkiLDcnWigzsN8t61si28W3kWWT2MQfk.jpg)\n\n---\n\n### Lisboa, Portugal\n\nAnother postcard from Portugal, this is from @xrayman whom I met briefly (along with pardinus) from Amsterdam HF last year. This was sent on 28th April and I received it  on 19th May, so about 3 weeks.  \n\nI have nice memories of Lisbon even though I was only there for a day 10 years ago!!! My best memory is the tram ride and a shabby looking shop selling some mouth watering roast suckilng pig, it was so delicious. Sadly I think that shop doesn't exist anymore as I recommended it to a friend  who was visiting Lisbon the other year and they said it wasn't there.  So I guess it's time to go back again sometime, and maybe some of my new found local friends can help me find an equally yummy place 😄\n![20230605_095913.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/livinguktaiwan/EpCBuVN4kRAQSURXFZ5Zjfa8jBSmxph5MZR3uvszgqehiMBgDeysDfS24K8MvLghnZ1.jpg)\n\nIt took me a while to find information on this stamp.  It was released in 2022 and is part of a set called \"*The Romeiros of Sao Miguel - 500 Years Since the Earthquake in Vila Franca Do Campo*\". Sao Miguel is an island in Portugal and a big earthquake erupted in 1522 at the town Vila Franca Do Campo on the island.  It's amazing the things you learn when you're on Hive. All you need is to be curiuos.\n\n![20230606_122845.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/livinguktaiwan/EoeHoLb41KTYwUWZHAWSMb1LuzL52FokopDZvnvceSzhnpNjJLGpnHimZuTfRApqzFa.jpg)\n\n---\n\n### Durban, South Africa\n\nI'm so upset that my postcard from Taiwan to South Africa still has not arrived after 89 days, yet it only took just over two months for @lizelle's postcard to get to me in UK.  I know two months sounds like a long time, but it's still a lot quicker than non arrival!!  And of course, we wouldn't expect anything less than a lion from South Africa!!  I love the proverb \"*Do not flee from a roaring lion towards a crouching lion*\".  You never now what danger lies ahead and you could be running from one to another.\n\n![20230605_095900.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/livinguktaiwan/EpxtH2jgBFntvGwmGc43kxGz9Pe7ejBGptnf8mXsqM5G8zqafMGHT2beeyjmCDkMS8z.jpg)\n\nThe stamp is a white rhino, a near extinct creature with only around 20k in the world.  I don't think I've ever seen a real one before as I'm not big on wildlife and  animals, particularly those locked up in zoos.  However it's great to know that work is being done by people to conserve these valuable creatures.\n![20230605_100110_20230606121541582.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/livinguktaiwan/EowJ4JZmGfCHaauhUm7waPQK3ntFhnvFEn9fy4qqFjqAAoe8rmSFayPvy3hUuaxmqEL.jpg)\n\n---\n\n### Drôme, France\nAnd last but not the least, I received this from @anttn last week.  He sent it on 20th May and it took two weeks for it to swim across the 33km English Channel from France to UK.  By the way, did you know, the first time a person swam across the English Channel was in 1875 and it took him nearly 22 hours.  Now, the fastest on record is an Australian who did it under 7 hours in 2012!!\n\nAnyway, I digress.  I caught a glimpse of this postcard when anttn posted about his [visit to a peony farm](https://peakd.com/hive-196308/@anttn/iris-and-peonies-visiting-two-flower-growers-in-the-fields) a few weeks ago, and he got the postcard there.  I can imagine how beautiful actually being there would be, with the array of colours from over 600 variety of peonies and that stunning view.  Thank for sending a piece of that over to UK.\n\nThere was no stamp on this postcard as it came in an envelope with one of those electronic code stamps.\n![20230605_095933.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/livinguktaiwan/Ep7vxttjLaZmafpX3Qa42vw2JBhtKKirTHfqtXTo2QsByozaraHGhFVG5w9GNYobFue.jpg)\n\n\n![livinguktaiwan divider.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/livinguktaiwan/fuGLEHxS-livinguktaiwan20divider.png)\n\nIt was very nice to learn a lot more about the world through these postcards I received from friends on Hive.

It is the SEC's job to provide regulatory clarity.  They refuse.  It's the SECs job to protect investors, yet no one in crypto feels protected by any of this.  Gary Gensler is a snake and a liar.  The words coming out of his mouth simply do not match his actions. \n\n\n![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/edicted/23tbMTtvfTAgN7GK9hQwJ16mQRChyswVfVbe21D6KsWD825e3ifM9tAVHjCFLnTLUDhvZ.png)\n\nMost recently we see that the recent dip in crypto was caused by this nonsense.  Of course it's not complete nonsense as we've all seen how shady Binance can be.  Shame the SEC refuses to acknowledge what Binance did during our own hostile takeover, because that's a grievance actually worth addressing. \n\nAmong the allegations presented are \"co-mingling funds\" like FTX did (except FTX was much much worse) while at the same time allowing users to still use the service with a VPN.  Of course what the SEC never addresses is why Americans would want to continue using Binance in the first place given that everyone has already known these things for years. \n\n###### People want to use Binance because it provides a service that people want: \n* cheap trading fees \n* deep liquidity pools\n* access to hundreds of assets\n\nThe SEC and other Binance poo-poo-ers are always quick to point out that Binance \"makes Billions of Dollars in transaction fees\".  Yeah... duh... that's their entire business model jackass.  What they seem to forget to mention is that Binance has the lowest fees in the entire business.  Protecting investors by forcing them to pay more fees?  Yeah... very smart.   And it's not a small amount more either.  DEXes cost triple and Coinbase costs x6 the fees of Binance. It's absurd on every level.  Isn't it just far more likely that the motives at play here are tainted and corrupt? \n\n#### Of course this is all well-deserved.\nThere are legitimate reasons to take CZ to task, but a lot of these accusations, even if true, just feel like mudslinging to me with very little evidence to back it up.  Considering the SEC's crusade against crypto and their refusal to do their own job: that narrative makes a bit more sense than actually trying to \"protect investors\".  This is all feeling a bit political and corrupt across the board at the moment. \n\n#### OMG WHY DID BTC CRASH $25k!?!\nI think it's a bit comical that people are flipping out over the price... I've been talking about $25k since February.  $25k was the resistance line to beat for the entire month.  Of course there was a great chance we'd retest this level as support.  In fact I expect the price to dip slightly under $25k and cut into the $24k or even $23k range before the FUD gets lifted. The fact that crypto is as high as it is shocks me to the core. \n\nIf we look at how bad everything actually is with the economy and the regulators and the fudsters honestly Bitcoin should be like $8k-$10k right now scraping the bottom.  Hive should be like 8-10 cents in an environment like this... and yet the price towers above the gutter numbers but everyone still manages to flip out and panic sell a 5%-10% dip.  Craziness.  Have some perspective fam!  We're honestly not doing that bad. \n\n--------------\n\n\n#### Crypto can't get weaker. \nAs much as the government loves to stomp on it right now, political corruption is just one more reason why crypto needs to exist. The value of crypto will continue to grow, and the players therein will continue to grow more powerful.  At a certain point the SEC is going to step on the wrong set of toes and they are going to get slapped hard (assuming they actually win the Ripple lawsuit and we have to wait longer than the outcome there).  \n\nIt's quite inevitable that given this blatant overreach combined with in the intrinsic need for crypto to exist that eventually the SEC will lose a gigantic case which will dwindle their reputation to all time lows.  Once that ice is cracked their own tarnished reputation will lose them dozens of more cases in the years to come, and more importantly embolden the victims of these cases to fight back knowing that they can actually win legitimately.  And perhaps even more importantly than that it will finally force the issue of the SEC actually providing clarity... a thing they refuse to do because it guts their own regulation by enforcement power-play. \n\nIt's a bit funny that Gensler calls crypto the Wild West under the context that he'll be the one to bring everyone to heel.  LoL, good one buddy.  As if a single person or agency can prevent a tidal wave of decentralization from sweeping across the entire globe.  Over and over again we hear this: crypto is the \"Wild West\" and this phase will not last very long... except the entire point of decentralization is to break all the established rulesets and put communities in charge of their own sovereignty.  \n\n#### The \"Wild West\" phase of crypto is never going to end... \nIn fact it's going to escalate to levels that most people would have never dreamed of.  Again, that's the entire point of this technology: to break the chains of imperialism and controlling communities using centralized authority.  Anyone who thinks we've already peaked is fooling themselves.  Even during the gold rush the Wild West of America lasted several decades.  The train robberies and saloon shootouts will continue on unabated, and agencies like the SEC can only add fuel to the fire, not the other way around. \n\n#### Conclusion\nWell we made it past the 4-year cycle bear market year of 2022, but the economy is still jacked and the regulators are still flexing hard and kicking us while we are down. Luckily no amount of regulatory peacocking could possibly hold a flame to the LUNA collapse into the FTX collapse.  Crypto has already bottomed (at least Bitcoin has) and sits well below the doubling curve trendline (which will be $100k EOY).  All we have to do from here is hunker down and wait for the skies to clear.  The risk-on environment we're looking for is much closer than it appears on paper.
