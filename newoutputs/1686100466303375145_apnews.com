Around one million have fled across the border to Bangladesh, only to find themselves trapped for years in a squalid camp and held hostage by migration policies that have given them almost no way out.\u003c/p>\u003cp>And so, in a bid to get somewhere — anywhere — safe, they are taking to the sea.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It is a life-or-death gamble. Last year, more than 3,500 Rohingya attempted to cross the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea — a 360 percent increase over the previous year, according to United Nations figures that are almost certainly an undercount. At least 348 people died or went missing, the highest death toll since 2014.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It’s impossible to know whether any of those lives could have been saved, because almost no one was looking to save them in the first place. Instead, the Rohingya are often abandoned and left to die on the water, just as on land. Even when officials knew the boats’ locations in recent months, the United Nations’ refugee agency says its repeated pleas to maritime authorities to rescue some of them have gone ignored.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Governments ignore the Rohingya because they can. While multiple international laws mandate the rescue of vessels in distress, enforcement is difficult.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In the past, the region’s coastal nations hunted for boats in trouble — only to push them into other countries’ search and rescue zones, says Chris Lewa, director of the Arakan Project, which monitors the Rohingya crisis. But now, they rarely even bother to look.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"8d036a1b25b44f76a8e2f9e7cc6c915d\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The lucky ones are eventually towed to shore in Indonesia by local fishermen. Yet even rescue can be perilous — a Vietnamese oil company saved one boat, then promptly handed the Rohingya over to \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ap-top-news-international-news-asia-bangladesh-massacres-484246542340481598a8bba5a548d6a7\">the same deadly regime in Myanmar\u003c/a> from which they’d fled. And the Myanmar authorities themselves patrol for Rohingya migrants.\u003c/p>\u003cp>There is no reason why regional governments could not or cannot coordinate and rescue these boats, says John Quinley, director of human rights group Fortify Rights.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It was a total lack of political will and extremely heartless,” he says. “The accountability and the onus really lies on everyone.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Several countries in the region did not respond to requests for comment.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The reasons the Rohingya escape are written on face after gaunt face, in haunted eyes and across slumped shoulders. Any hope that once existed in the Bangladesh camps has long since died, replaced by a stoic sadness and a palpable fear. These are a people who have come to expect nothing, and often get that or worse.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Most of the Rohingya in these camps fled what the United States has declared a \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-myanmar-united-nations-5e4a1351468f4755a6f861e39ec782c9\">genocide in Myanmar in 2017\u003c/a>. In recent years, however, brutal killings by gangs and warring militant groups — many in broad daylight — have become commonplace.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"8cd70a32d69749089bbfb3348428bc08\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Fires are frequent, some of them acts of arson. One afternoon in March, a blaze that investigators say was set by criminals tore through thousands of shelters. The billowing smoke was so thick and black it blocked the view of the sun. Wide-eyed children huddled together, crying, as the inferno left 15,000 homeless.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Beyond fear is hunger. The Rohingya are banned from working and rely on food rations, which have been slashed due to a drop in global donations. Meanwhile, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-myanmar-technology-e5c0036949f7e7fb8ce1da5884f250a4\">a military coup in 2021 in Myanmar\u003c/a> has made any \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/myanmar-torture-military-prisons-insein-abuse-390fe5b49337be82ce91639e93e0192f\">safe return home at best a distant dream\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\u003cp>And so, out of options, they do again what they have done before: They flee.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"0215fdf0-ed50-11ed-ffa6-7104d472524e\" class=\"related-story-embed\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Jutting up from the dust and the dirt of Nayapara camp in Bangladesh are bamboo, tarp and tin huts jammed along labyrinthine pathways.\u003c/p>\u003cp>This tight-knit warren is Block H, home to Setera and 64 other passengers, including the boat’s captain, Jamal Hussein.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Virtually everyone in Block H was connected to the boat somehow. Many residents have spent most, or all, of their lives here, after fleeing Myanmar during earlier waves of violence. Their shelters now bake below sun-scorched mountains that are home to violent gangs.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Jamal himself was afraid for his life, says his sister, Bulbul. Inside her shadowy shelter, she weeps at the memories of her brother. “He was my heart,” she says.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Back in Myanmar, Jamal was a rice farmer and a youth leader of their village. After his dad died, he became a father figure to his younger siblings, including Bulbul, who was 15 years his junior.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Their life in the camps was difficult, she says, but they managed. More recently, though, Jamal had received death threats, Bulbul says. He started making plans to get out.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He bought a boat and took a video of it to share with prospective passengers. In the video, obtained by the Associated Press, the wooden vessel sits docked in murky brown water. It appears old and shabby, with a cramped compartment below deck, and clearly too small to safely carry 180 people 1,800 kilometers (1,100 miles) to Indonesia, Jamal’s target.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"782b4e00dd3f46f1bf1e0ded353e694c\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv id=\"fb738c0e6c8e477c8739bbb738eca857\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv id=\"ad236132c8dc469ca38cb9a3b7bb3923\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>From there, most passengers planned to make their way to their ultimate destination, Malaysia.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Though Bulbul denies it, residents of Block H say Jamal was a seasoned captain who had successfully guided several other boats of Rohingya refugees across the sea. It was his experience, they say, along with his willingness to put 16 of his own relatives on the boat — including his wife, six children, five grandchildren and two pregnant daughters-in-law— that prompted so many to trust him. One mother said Jamal promised her he would watch over her teenage son and daughter along with his children.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In a shelter a short walk from Jamal’s, Setera’s father holds up a photo of his daughter, with her full lips and wide-set eyes so much like her mother’s.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“She was the most beautiful person in our family,” says Abdu Shukkur.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Shukkur had never heard anyone say a bad word about Setera, a warm and doting mother to her own daughters. She rarely complained, despite raising her girls on her own in the misery of the camps since 2012. That’s the year her husband, Rashid, fled to Malaysia to support his family with the wages he sent from his restaurant job.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>But the money had also made the family targets of kidnappers, Shukkur says, and Setera had begun to fear for their lives. The local gangs know which of the block’s residents have relatives abroad who could afford a ransom.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Two years ago, they snatched Setera’s 4-year-old nephew and took him to the mountains, Shukkur says. They held him there for 6 days, drugging him to keep him quiet. The family eventually paid a ransom of 300,000 taka ($2,800) to get him back — a fortune in the camps.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In late November, Setera went to her father and asked his permission to go on Jamal’s boat, along with her two younger daughters, aged 18 and 15. Her eldest daughter was married and would stay behind.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Shukkur forbade her to go.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“If you want to go to Malaysia by boat, just divorce your husband,” he told her. “It’s too dangerous.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>His wife, Gul Faraz, intervened. “She’s been living without her husband here for 11 years now,” Faraz said. “Let her go.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"d6a0e36bec7f4debae2afc37c9d8aea4\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Shukkur relented.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Grief steals his breath as he recounts his goodbye with his granddaughters, and he pauses to calm himself. They had a habit of stealing Shukkur’s unripe guavas, plums and mangoes whenever they visited, prompting scoldings from their grandfather.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Grandpa, you will not need to scold us anymore,” one of the girls told Shukkur. “Everything will be all right.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Setera, angry that her father had tried to stop her, did not come to say goodbye.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In a nearby shelter, another family was in agony.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Jamal’s cousin, Muhammed Ayub, was fighting to stop his daughter, Samira, and her children, aged 6 and nine months old, from getting on the boat. But his son-in-law, Kabir Ahmed, was resolute. Villagers outside the camps had beaten him with an iron rod, and he was afraid.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It is not safe here. People are getting killed every day,” Ahmed told his father-in-law. “If you stop me from leaving, I will not visit you anymore.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>And so, powerless, Ayub hugged his daughter and son-in-law goodbye. Then, riddled with anxiety, he wrapped his grandsons in an embrace. His entire body ached as he watched them leave.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“They were my lovely ones,” he says.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"social-embed\" id=\"se2:b16cb7d0-ed50-11ed-d23b-1b80838f5470\">\u003cdiv style=\"position:relative;overflow:hidden;padding-bottom:56.25%\">\u003ciframe src=\"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/players/Sz71oWjm-oOPvcXwU.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"auto\" title=\"Frantic call helps untangle mystery of Rohingya boat\" style=\"position:absolute;\" allowfullscreen>\u003c/iframe>\u003c/div>\u003cp class=\"social-caption\">A boat carrying 180 Rohingya refugees set out from Bangladesh on December 1. One week later, the boat vanished. The Associated Press reconstructed the journey based on interviews, videos, and calls from the boat.\nAP video by Al-emrun Garjon Production: McKinnon de Kuyper, Marshall Ritzel and Peter Hamlin\u003c/p>\u003c/div>\u003cp>At the southernmost tip of mainland Bangladesh lies a wild, wind-swept beach, fringed to the east by forest and mountains and to the west by the Bay of Bengal. This stretch of grey sand is barren but for a few wooden fishing boats and an army of bright red crabs that hide in their holes when any human comes near.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It was from here that a small fishing boat began ferrying passengers to Jamal’s waiting vessel. The AP has reconstructed their journey based on interviews with 28 relatives of those on board, audio recordings of calls from the boat, interviews with three eyewitnesses, and photos and videos.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Late on the night of Dec. 1 and through around 4 a.m. the following day, many of those on Jamal’s boat called their anxious families.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It was only then that Setera told her husband she and two daughters were headed his way.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Rashid had told them countless times never to get on a boat. But this time, Setera would not be stopped. She told him she’d sold her jewelry to help pay for their passage, a total of 360,000 taka ($3,400).\u003c/p>\u003cp>Rashid was stunned. He apologized to Setera for any mistakes he’d made in their 20 years of marriage. And then, he says, he heard Jamal tell Setera to get off the phone. She hung up.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Rashid began to cry with excitement and fear. He couldn’t believe he might soon see his girls.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"02a581f87a9647e89efaddfc120ffbd3\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Setera made at least one more call, to her father, Shukkur.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The boat is waiting for fuel,” Setera said. “We’re leaving soon, and we’ll be out of service.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Shukkur was too angry to speak. He couldn’t believe she hadn’t even come to say goodbye. So he passed her mobile number onto his nephew in Malaysia, and told him to ring Setera and order her to come home.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Meanwhile, Jamal’s daughter-in-law, Bibi Ayesha, called her parents to say she and her family had also made it on board. Alongside Bibi was her 17-year-old brother, her husband, and her 3-year-old son, Abu.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The little boy was frightened of the water. Bibi and her husband passed him back and forth, trying to comfort him, as they spoke with her parents. “Pray for us,” they said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Jamal got on the phone with the parents to reassure them. “The boat is big,” Jamal said, according to the couple. “We have enough food for 15 days.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Asma Bibi, who was married to another of Jamal’s sons, also made a call to her mother, Hasina Khatun. Eighteen-year-old Asma was 9 months pregnant, and excited to meet her child after a stillbirth with her first baby one year earlier.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Asma hadn’t wanted to go on the boat, says Hasina. But Asma’s husband did.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“How can I stay here without my husband? I’m pregnant,” Asma had told her nervous mother days earlier. “How can my child survive without a father?”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"50fc20ba040f40d1812435a3e5a18f9d\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>And so, Hasina gave her daughter two sets of baby clothes — one pink, and one white, since they didn’t know the baby’s gender. She also gave her daughter medicine, towels and a green blanket to wrap the newborn in after birth.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Asma packed them along with snacks from her father’s shop, plus three sets of clothes to fit her pregnant and postpartum body. Then Asma reluctantly followed her husband onto Jamal’s boat, along with her 13-year-old brother.\u003c/p>\u003cp>At 4:04 a.m., back in Block H, Jannat Ara’s phone rang. It was her aunt, Kurshida Begum, who said she’d boarded with her husband and two sons, aged 3 and 4.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In the recorded call, shared with the AP, Kurshida recites a prayer, then asks her niece to do the same.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The journey has begun,\" Kurshida told her niece. \u003c/p>\u003cp>News of the call quickly reached Kurshida’s mother-in-law, Momina Begum, who became hysterical. She had no idea Kurshida and the boys were on the boat.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Where are you going with these children?” Momina screamed. “Why are you crossing the dangerous sea with these children?”\u003c/p>\u003cp>But it was too late. Jamal’s boat was headed into the Bay of Bengal.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"a4a2cf11574f46d985efd74152dc55a3\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>What happened next is best told through the eyes of the refugees on yet another boat that set out for Indonesia one day later.\u003c/p>\u003cp>On board were 104 people, including a man named Kafayet Ullah. According to Kafayet, he was merely a passenger. According to others, he was the captain.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Not long into the journey, Kafayet spotted a boat in the distance. As they moved closer, they realized the boat was Jamal’s. And it was in trouble.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Jamal called out that his engine was having problems. He borrowed some electrical wire from Kafayet’s boat and went to work repairing the fault.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Kafayet was worried. His own niece and nephew were aboard Jamal’s vessel, which looked old and overloaded, the passengers packed in tight like animals.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But unlike Kafayet, Jamal had experience and a satellite phone. So when Jamal finished fixing the engine, he set off again, and Kafayet followed.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"42365bff909245589058499369182356\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Four days later, the sky cracked open.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A powerful storm descended upon them. The boats thrashed in the merciless waves. Kafayet’s terrified passengers sobbed as the rain pounded down and the tempest washed their supplies overboard.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The water in Kafayet’s boat began to rise, and a man on board spotted sharks. The passengers prepared themselves to die.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Through the darkness, they could see a light shining on Jamal’s boat.

Kafayet threw empty water drums overboard in case his niece or nephew or any of the others could grab onto them.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He says he couldn’t see anyone in the water. But he could hear them screaming.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Then the screams stopped.

In shelter after shelter came the wails of families cracking apart.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Jamal’s cousin, Muhammed Ayub, was lying on his mat when he received the recording. As he listened, he began to howl in agony.\u003c/p>\u003cp>All he has left now of the grandsons he called his “lovely ones” are their clothing and his memories. He stares at a pair of little brown shoes with Velcro straps that 6-year-old Tasin once wore, and weeps. When he holds them, he says, he feels he is holding his grandson.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Crouched on the floor next to him, his wife, Minara Begum, inhales the scent from their daughter Samira’s yellow dress. Then she presses a pair of 9-month-old Samir’s tiny blue shorts to her face, the fabric growing damp with her tears.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Oh, my grandson, why did you leave?” she moans. “Where have you gone?”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Families already pushed to breaking point are now broken. One man who lost four relatives tried to kill himself.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Momina Begum, whose young grandsons were on board, feels she is burning in a fire or sinking under water. She sits next to a plastic basket of her 4-year-old grandson’s toys and searches for the will to live.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It would be better to kill us by poison instead of taking away my family,” she says.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"96164cece8394af2abd1d91e15db7fa7\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Hasina Khatun, whose pregnant daughter, Asma, and 13-year-old son were on the boat, now finds herself begging to hold other people’s babies. She wasn’t able to hold her daughter’s stillborn baby, either, she says through tears.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Hasina, like some others, still holds out hope her loved ones are alive. Without their bodies, they say, their deaths are difficult to accept.\u003c/p>\u003cp>One man, Muhammed Rashid, believes he sees his teenage son, Saiful, in an online photo of Rohingya refugees in Indonesia. He had it laminated.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Muhammed cradles Saiful’s backpack in his lap. He pulls down a sack of his boy’s belongings and dumps it on the bed, a strangled sob erupting from his throat. Then he tenderly kisses his son’s English book, on which Saiful had scrawled: “I love you.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“My son is everything,” Muhammed murmurs. “We believe he is alive.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>But the only known survivors from that night were Kafayet and his passengers. \u003c/p>\u003cp>After Jamal’s boat sank, they drifted for another 10 days, their engine damaged, their food and water gone. Kafayet’s brother could not stop crying, thinking about what must have happened to their niece and nephew. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Delirious with thirst and hunger, they suddenly spotted a speed boat in the distance and frantically waved their clothes in the air.

He hopes no one else will attempt to do what they did.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Yet back in the camps, such plans are already underway.

In recent years, however, brutal killings by gangs and warring militant groups — many in broad daylight — have become commonplace. So, too, have fires, some of them acts of arson.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Beyond the spiralling security situation is worsening hunger. The Rohingya are banned from working and rely on food rations, which have been slashed due to a drop in global donations.

Still, that excitement was muted by a disquieting sense of having just passed through a gateway that eventually will lead society down another avenue of digital isolation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE POTENTIAL UPSIDES\u003c/p>\u003cp>But first the good stuff: Vision Pro is a highly sophisticated device that is fairly easy to set up and incredibly intuitive to use. The setup requires using an iPhone to automatically take some assessments of your eyes and ears. If you wear prescription glasses (I wear contacts) some additional calibration will be needed, but Apple promises that won't be complicated.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cdiv id='afs:Card:242019583894' class='hub-peek-embed' content-id='9f81b5cb055f601ea2f40e4a93a54f14'>Hub peek embed (apf-technology) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) \u003c/div>\u003cp>Once that's all done, you will quickly find that putting on the Vision Pro is also simple, thanks to a knob on the side that makes it easy to ensure a the headset fits comfortably. And unlike other headsets, the Vision Pro isn't an awkward-looking piece of nerdware, although the goggles aren't exactly chic, despite looking a bit like something you might see people wearing on a ski slope, jet fighter or race car.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Controlling the Vision Pro is astoundingly easy. Users just press a button above the right goggle to pull up a virtual screen of apps, including familiar standbys for photos, messaging, phone calls, video streaming and web browsing. Opening an app just requires looking straight at it, then pinching a thumb and finger together. The same app can be closed with a finger pinch or can be moved to the side by holding two fingers together and moving them in the direction where you want to place it. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Not surprisingly, Apple's well-curated demonstration cast the Vision Pro in the best-possible light. The headset clearly seems like it could be quite popular for business purposes, improving productivity, collaboration and video conferencing, especially in an era when more work is being done remotely.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Without causing the disorienting effects common in other virtual-reality headsets, the Vision Pro can immerse you in stunning visuals, 3-D displays of faraway places. It can insert you into videos of past memories recorded with one of the device's 12 cameras (the demo included heartwarming scenes of a child's birthday party and a campfire scene). It can make watching a 3-D movie, such as the latest Avatar film, feel like you are sitting in an IMAX theater while relaxing on your own couch. It can thrust you into surreal moments (at one point, I watched in wonder as a butterfly first shown in a virtual screen depicting a prehistoric era seemingly fluttered across the room and landed in my outstretched hand as I sat on a couch).\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>And the demo featured just enough glimpses of the way sporting events appear through the goggles to realize that the powers that be in professional and collegiate football, basketball, baseball and hockey are bound to find ways to incorporate the technology into subscription services that make viewers feel like they are sitting in the front row.\u003c/p>\u003cp>To Apple's credit, the Vision Pro is also designed in a way that allows users to still see those around them, if they so choose.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE POTENTIAL DOWNSIDES \u003c/p>\u003cp>My mixed feelings about Apple's first foray into mixed reality ironically stems from just how well-designed the Vision Pro is by a company that has been behind \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/apple-breakthrough-products-iphone-macintosh-ipad-headset-0cacc046f6a994a58d202a85e8f29d70\">this sort of game-changing technology on numerous occasions during the past 40 years\u003c/a>, ranging from the Macintosh computer to the iPhone.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It feels like this may be another instance in which Apple has accomplished something that has eluded other tech companies by cracking the code to make both virtual- and augmented-reality more compelling and less disorienting than a variety of other ho-hum headsets have done over the past decade or so.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The only reason the Vision Pro isn't going to be an immediate sensation is its cost. When it hits the U.S. market early next year, it will sell for $3,500, which makes it probable it will start out as a luxury item unaffordable to most households — especially because the headset isn't going to supplant the need to buy a new iPhone or smartphone running on Android every few years.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The most likely scenario is that Vision Pro in some ways is Apple’s testbed for mixed reality that will encourage the development of more apps especially designed to take advantage of the technology. The next ripple effect will be an array of other products equipped with similarly compelling technology at lower price points that stand a better chance sucking more people — including children — into a realm that threatens to deepen screen addictions to the detriment of real-world interactions among humans.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Michael Liedtke has been covering Silicon Valley for The Associated Press for 23 years. \u003c/p>","sponsored":false,"contentBundle":null,"localMemberName":null,"media":[{"id":"a92b97e85a404c1b9714aa929e623483","type":"Photo","caption":"\u003cp>File - The Apple Vision Pro headset is displayed in a showroom on the Apple campus after it's unveiling on Monday, June 5, 2023, in Cupertino, Calif.

She was 101.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Gilot’s daughter, Aurelia Engel, told The Associated Press her mother had died at Mount Sinai West hospital after suffering both lung and heart problems. “She was an extremely talented artist, and we will be working on her legacy and the incredible paintings and works she is leaving us with,” Engel said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The French-born Gilot had long made her frustration clear that despite acclaim for her art, which she produced from her teenage years until five years ago, she would still be best known for her relationship with the older Picasso, whom she met in 1943 at age 21, his junior by four decades. The union produced two children — Claude and Paloma Picasso. But unlike the other key women in Picasso’s life — wives or paramours — Gilot eventually walked out.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>“He never saw it coming,” Engel said of her mother's departure. “She was there because she loved him and because she really believed in that incredible passion of art which they both shared. (But) she came as a free, though very, very young, but very independent person.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>Gilot herself told The Guardian newspaper in 2016 that \"I was not a prisoner” in the relationship.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I’d been there of my own will, and I left of my own will,\" she said, then 94. \"That’s what I told him once, before I left. I said: ‘Watch out, because I came when I wanted to, but I will leave when I want.’ He said, ‘Nobody leaves a man like me.’ I said, ‘We’ll see.’ ”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Gilot wrote several books, the most famous of which was “Life with Picasso,” written in 1964 with Carlton Lake. An angry Picasso sought unsuccessfully to ban its publication. “He attacked her in court, and he lost three times,\" said Engel, 66, an architect by training who now manages her mother's archives. But, she said, \"after the third loss he called her and said congratulations. He fought it, but at the same time, I think he was proud to have been with a woman who had such guts like he had.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Born on Nov. 26, 1921, in leafy Neuilly-sur-Seine in suburban Paris, Gilot was an only child. “She knew at the age of five that she wanted to be a painter,” Engel said. In accordance with her parents' wishes, she studied law, however, while maintaining art as her true passion. She first exhibited her paintings in 1943. \u003c/p>\u003cp>That was the year she met Picasso, by chance, when she and a friend visited a restaurant on the Left Bank, amid a gathering that included his then-companion, Dora Maar. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>\"I was 21 and I felt that painting was already my whole life,\" she writes in “Life With Picasso.” When Picasso asked Gilot and her friend what they did, the friend responded that they were painters, to which Picasso responded, Gilot writes: “That's the funniest thing I've heard all day. Girls who look like that can't be painters.” The two were invited to visit Picasso in his studio, and the relationship soon began. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Not long after leaving Picasso in 1953, Gilot reunited with a former friend, artist Luc Simon, and married him in 1955. They had a daughter — Engel — and divorced in 1962. In 1970, Gilot married Jonas Salk, the American virologist and researcher famed for his work with the polio vaccine, and began living between California and Paris, and later New York. When he died in 1995, Gilot moved full-time to New York and spent her last years on the Upper West Side. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Her art only increased in value over the years. In 2021 her “Paloma à la Guitare” (1965) sold for $1.3 million at a Sotheby’s auction. Her work has shown in many prominent museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art. Her life with Picasso was illustrated in the 1996 movie “Surviving Picasso,” directed by James Ivory. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Simon Shaw, Sotheby’s vice chairman for global fine art, said it had been gratifying to see, in the past decade, Gilot's paintings “achieve the recognition they truly deserved.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“To see Françoise as a muse (to Picasso) is to miss the point,\" Shaw wrote in an e-mail. “She was established on her course as a painter when first she met Pablo. While her work naturally entered into dialogue with his, Françoise pursued a course fiercely her own — her art, like her character, was filled with color, energy and joy.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Engel noted that although the relationship with Picasso was clearly a difficult one, it gave her mother a certain freedom from her parents and the constraints of a bourgeois life — and perhaps enabled her to pursue her true dream of being a professional painter, a passion she shared with Picasso above all else. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“They both believed that art was the only thing in life worth doing,” she said. “And she was able to be her true self, even though it was not an easy life with him. But still she was able to be her true self.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>And for Engel, her mother's key legacy was not only her creativity but her courage, reflected in her art, which was always changing, never staying safe.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“She was not without fear. But she would always confront her fears and jump in the void and take risks, no matter what,” Engel said.\u003c/p>","sponsored":false,"contentBundle":null,"localMemberName":null,"media":[{"id":"463e3c72a2a0466ab2c240a5b6d8269d","type":"Photo","caption":"\u003cp>FILE - Artist Francois Gilot poses with her work at a personal art exhibition in Milan, Dec. 21, 1965.

If we do, we get what we deserve, and we will have to own it.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Christie advisers are planning a nontraditional, nationally focused campaign based on earned media attention, instead of focusing on specific states.

And two, it’s the way to win.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Christie will test the appetite among Republican voters for someone who has expressed support for many of Trump's policies but has criticized the former president's conduct. The former governor has urged the party to move on or risk future losses.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Other Republicans with similar views, including former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan and New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, have opted against their own campaigns, expressing concerns that having more candidates in the race will only benefit Trump.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Christie was at one point seen as one of the Republican Party’s brightest political stars as the popular Republican governor of a Democratic state. But despite persistent urging from top donors and party officials, he declined to run for president in 2012. By the time he announced in 2016, his reputation had been tarnished by the “Bridgegate” scandal in which aides were accused of wreaking traffic havoc in Fort Lee, New Jersey, in an apparent effort to punish the city’s mayor for failing to endorse his reelection bid.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The former governor has known Trump for nearly 20 years but their relationship has been complicated. Christie was on the shortlist to serve as Trump’s vice president, oversaw Trump’s early White House transition efforts, said he was offered — and turned down — multiple Cabinet positions, and helped Trump prepare for each of his general election debates in 2016 and 2020. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But Christie also clashed with Trump at times and has described the former president’s refusal to accept his 2020 election loss to Biden as a breaking point. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Christie opting to start his 2024 bid at a New Hampshire town hall recalled his first run at the White House, when he focused on the state, holding dozens of New Hampshire town hall events only to finish sixth in its primary. He dropped out of that race shortly afterward. \u003c/p>\u003cp>After his speech Tuesday, Christie took extended questions from the audience — a common occurrence in early voting states that DeSantis was hesitant to do when launching his campaign. Christie also talked openly about his underwhelming 2016 performance, despite concentrating so heavily on New Hampshire. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I lost,\" Christie laughed. \"You people did that to me in 2016.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Colvin reported from New York.

There also is a team component. The league is run by Greg Norman, a former PGA Tour star who tried nearly 30 years ago to create a world tour. LIV Golf lured away 13 former major champions, including Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson, who then were suspended by the PGA Tour.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003chl2>WHY DID SAUDI ARABIA WANT TO CREATE A GOLF LEAGUE?\u003c/hl2>\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003chl2>\u003c/hl2>\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>The kingdom has been investing in sports and entertainment in recent years as part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's initiative called “Vision 2030” to diversify and reduce its dependence on oil.

PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan says he couldn't match Saudi money, but it wasn't because of a lack of effort. This year the PGA Tour had 13 “elevated events” with $20 million purses. For 2024, it has returned its schedule to start in January and end in August. There will be about 15 tournaments with $20 million purses — nearly twice as much as they were — for the top 50 in the season points race on the PGA Tour.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003chl2>WHY DID THE PGA TOUR MERGE WITH LIV GOLF?\u003c/hl2>\u003c/p>\u003cp>Monahan refused to meet with the Saudi Golf group for two years. But a few months ago, PGA Tour board member Jimmy Dunne arranged a meeting. Monahan, European tour CEO Keith Pelley and Al-Rumayyan began working out an agreement. Monahan realized LIV Golf had a deep well of funds and wasn't going anywhere. He says golf was too divided and had too much tension and it was best for everyone to come together. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003chl2>WHO WILL BE IN CHARGE OF THE PGA TOUR AFTER THE MERGER?\u003c/hl2>\u003c/p>\u003cp>The PGA Tour policy board will add Al-Rumayyan, and then it will either add another player or remove one of the spots that belong to the corporate world. The new commercial company — it still doesn't have a name — will have Al-Rumayyan as the chairman and Monahan as the CEO. The PGA Tour will have a majority stake in the new company. However, PIF at first will be the exclusive investor alongside the PGA Tour, LIV Golf and the DP World Tour. Going forward, PIF will have the exclusive right to further invest.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The PGA Tour will keep tax-exempt status as a 501-c-6 organization that is charity driven. As far as fans are concerned, it will still be the same logo and the same tour. Ditto for the European tour, whose commercial name is DP World Tour.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003chl2>WHERE WILL THE LIV GOLF DEFECTORS PLAY NEXT YEAR?\u003c/hl2>\u003c/p>\u003cp>LIV Golf will finish its second season this year as scheduled. After that is anyone’s guess. Monahan says officials will conduct a thorough evaluation of how to integrate team golf into the PGA Tour. LIV Golf was trying to turn its 12 teams into franchises. No one had sponsored a team.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It is unlikely that if LIV Golf still exists, players can play both sides. That's what led to this in the first place. Curiously missing from all the announcements was Norman's name. Al-Rumayyan said on CNBC that he told Norman about the merging tours only a few minutes before the announcement.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{},"reporters":[{"id":"afs:Reporter:729258239977","fullName":"Doug Ferguson","displayName":"Doug Ferguson","biography":null,"twitterId":null,"email":null,"picture":null,"mediumKey":null,"showReporterPage":false,"showReporterBrief":false,"canonicalName":"doug-ferguson"}],"headlinePlacement":null,"relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false,"tagIds":["apf-trendingnews","apf-sports","apf-business","apf-usnews","SaudiArabia","GregNorman","apf-GeneralNews"],"tagObjs":[{"id":"apf-trendingnews","name":"Trending News","canonicalName":"trending-news","isPr":false,"isSuppressed":false,"navigationShortName":"More news"},{"id":"apf-sports","name":"Sports","canonicalName":"sports","isPr":false,"isSuppressed":false,"navigationShortName":null},{"id":"apf-business","name":"Business","canonicalName":"business","isPr":false,"isSuppressed":false,"navigationShortName":"Bank collapse"},{"id":"apf-usnews","name":"U.S. News","canonicalName":"us-news","isPr":false,"isSuppressed":false,"navigationShortName":null},{"id":"SaudiArabia","name":"Saudi Arabia","canonicalName":"saudi-arabia","isPr":false,"isSuppressed":false,"navigationShortName":null},{"id":"GregNorman","name":"Greg Norman","canonicalName":"greg-norman","isPr":false,"isSuppressed":false,"navigationShortName":null},{"id":"apf-GeneralNews","name":"General News","canonicalName":"general-news","isPr":false,"isSuppressed":false,"navigationShortName":null}]}],"disclaimerText":null,"dividerColor":null,"expandedStoryCount":null,"feed":[],"headlineWidget":false,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[{"id":"apf-trendingnews","name":"Trending News","canonicalName":"trending-news","isPr":false,"isSuppressed":false,"navigationShortName":"More news"},{"id":"apf-sports","name":"Sports","canonicalName":"sports","isPr":false,"isSuppressed":false,"navigationShortName":null},{"id":"apf-business","name":"Business","canonicalName":"business","isPr":false,"isSuppressed":false,"navigationShortName":"Bank collapse"},{"id":"apf-topnews","name":"AP Top News","canonicalName":"ap-top-news","isPr":false,"isSuppressed":false,"navigationShortName":null},{"id":"apf-usnews","name":"U.S. News","canonicalName":"us-news","isPr":false,"isSuppressed":false,"navigationShortName":null},{"id":"SaudiArabia","name":"Saudi Arabia","canonicalName":"saudi-arabia","isPr":false,"isSuppressed":false,"navigationShortName":null},{"id":"apf-EuropeanSports","name":"Sports -

Carter helped establish government observances of King's birthday and enabled the federal historic site encompassing King's birthplace, burial site and the family's Ebenezer Baptist Church.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The former president even served as private mediator for King’s children, helping settle an extended dispute over their parents’ estate. “I appreciate his efforts” ending the highly publicized fight, Bernice King said. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Barely 5 years old when her father was killed, the younger King said she does not “know for sure” when the families' friendship began.

He supported Johnson's election in 1964 and never aligned with segregationist colleagues in Atlanta, but Carter didn't speak out in favor of the federal laws during his two campaigns for governor, nor did he appear at Ebenezer, just a few blocks from the Georgia Capitol.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"afs:Card:369001264932\" content-id=\"9e9c411825a23c592a561331559cd4f9\" class=\"hub-peek-embed\">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout \u003c/div>\u003cp>When King was assassinated, Carter did not attend the funeral.

The senior King once described their conversations as “one country boy to another.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Carter paid the elder King an in-person visit to ask for his support at the outset of his presidential bid. Never a party loyalist, the elder King initially told Carter he would support his White House bid only if Republican Vice President Nelson Rockefeller did not run again. King’s reasoning: Carter was a longshot, while Rockefeller, a civil rights liberal, was already a heavyweight.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"3b8018e52f17422f9466834eca093ab2\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>When it became clear Rockefeller would not be President Gerald Ford's running mate in 1976, King endorsed Carter. It was an invaluable imprimatur for a white Southern governor from the same generation as segregationists like Alabama’s George Wallace and Georgia’s Lester Maddox.\u003c/p>\u003cp>King vouched for Carter in Black churches across the country and to the nearly all-white national press corps, particularly after Carter mangled federal housing policy discussions by defending “ethnic purity” in American neighborhoods.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Carter tried to clean up his remarks with more explanations, saying he would “oppose very strongly and aggressively\" any “exclusion of a family because of race or ethnic background” but still saw it as “good to maintain the homogeneity of neighborhoods if they've been established that way.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Carter eventually followed with an apology.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Bernice King said her grandfather saw Carter's word choices as “an innocent mistake\" and urged journalists and voters to see Carter’s values and full record. \u003c/p>\u003cp>During the first half of Carter's long life, “he had to navigate in a society, in a culture where, as a white person, you were expected to hate and see Black people in a very demeaning way,” Bernice King said.

Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist who oversaw the development of first atomic bomb during World War II, this will be especially pivotal in viewing the Trinity Test, the first detonation of a nuclear weapon.

Like “ \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-dunkirk-movies-north-america-christopher-nolan-0585e4e0cf2346b78103d5c6ac2026ec\">Dunkirk\u003c/a> ” and “ \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/tenet-christopher-nolan-spy-thriller-john-david-washington-0b0ec7aedde27e35a4debc252d35bbc7\">Tenet\u003c/a>,” “Oppenheimer” was filmed entirely on large format film stock, meaning a combination of IMAX 65mm and Panavision 65mm (think David Lean/\"Lawrence of Arabia\"), that’s then projected in 70mm.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“The sharpness and the clarity and the depth of the image is unparalleled,” Nolan said. “The headline, for me, is by shooting on IMAX 70mm film, you’re really letting the screen disappear. You’re getting a feeling of 3D without the glasses. You’ve got a huge screen and you’re filling the peripheral vision of the audience. You’re immersing them in the world of the film.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Nolan has been shooting with IMAX cameras since “The Dark Knight.” Audiences would regularly gasp at seeing its first shot projected in IMAX 70mm. Though it’s “just a helicopter shot” of some buildings in Chicago, it helps explain the ineffable power of the format.\u003c/p>\u003cp>On a technical level, the IMAX film resolution is almost 10 times more than a 35mm projector and each frame has some 18,000 pixels of resolution versus a home HD screen that has 1,920 pixels.\u003c/p>\u003ch2>WHY IS IT SHOT ON 65MM AND PROJECTED IN 70MM?\u003c/h2>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The 5mm difference goes back to when that extra space on the film had to be reserved for the soundtrack. With digital sound, that’s unnecessary and it is “purely a visual enhancement,” Nolan explained.\u003c/p>\u003ch2>DO THE DIFFERENT FORMATS IMPACT HOW THE FILM IS SHOT?\u003c/h2>\u003cp>“We have to plan very carefully because by shooting an IMAX film, you capture a lot of information,” he said. “Your movie is going to translate very well to all the formats because you’re getting the ultimate amount of visual information. But there are different shapes to the screen — what we call aspect ratios. What you have to plan is how you then frame your imagery so that it can be presented in different theaters with equal success.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Starting with “The Dark Knight,” they developed a system that they call “center punching the action\" so that nothing is lost.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"e878e4ecc3d3455193722365f4c61046\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema is also always aware of the “frame lines for the different theaters” when looking through the camera.\u003c/p>\u003cp>On the biggest presentations, IMAX 1.43:1 (the massive square screen) the screen essentially disappears for the audience. For other formats like 35mm, the top and the bottom get cropped.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But, Nolan said, “from a creative point of view, what we’ve found over the years is that there’s no compromise to composition.”\u003c/p>\u003ch2>WHY NOT MAKE AN ENTIRE MOVIE IN IMAX?\u003c/h2>\u003cp>The IMAX cameras are just too loud for dialogue heavy scenes, but Nolan is optimistic about the new cameras being developed.\u003c/p>\u003ch2>WHAT’S THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE BLACK AND WHITE SEQUENCES?\u003c/h2>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Some of “Oppenheimer” is presented in black and white for a very specific story reason.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I knew that I had two timelines that we were running in the film,” Nolan said. “One is in color, and that’s Oppenheimer’s subjective experience. That’s the bulk of the film. Then the other is a black and white timeline. It’s a more objective view of his story from a different character’s point of view.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Nolan’s desire for the black and white portions to be of equal image quality to the rest of the film led to the development of the first ever black and white IMAX film stock, which Kodak made and Fotokem developed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We shot a lot of our hair and makeup tests using black and white. And then we would go to the IMAX film projector at CityWalk and project it there,” he said. “I’ve just never seen anything like it. To see such a massive black and white film image? It’s just a wonderful thing.\"\u003c/p>\u003ch2>NOLAN’S FAVORITE THEATRICAL FORMATS\u003c/h2>\u003cp>For Nolan, the “best possible experience” to view “Oppenheimer” in theaters is the IMAX 70mm film presentations. These are also among the rarest, currently set for 25 locations in North America including the AMC Universal CityWalk in Los Angeles, the AMC Lincoln Square in New York, the Cinemark Dallas, the Regal King of Prussia near Philadelphia and the AutoNation IMAX in Fort Lauderdale.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"2771da1711d644d2a340662ebef7421d\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The prints span over 11 miles of film stock, weigh some 600 pounds and run through film projectors horizontally.\u003c/p>\u003cp>There will also be over one hundred 70mm prints (“a fabulous presentation,” Nolan said) sent to theaters around the world, with over 77 (and more to come) on sale in North America at major chains and many independent locations like the Music Box in Chicago and the AFI Silver in Washington D.C.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The two formats are sort of different and I love them both,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The sequences projected in IMAX 70mm really “come to life” on those screens, and vice versa for the 70mm sequences on those specific projectors. In IMAX theaters, for example, things shot with IMAX film cameras will expand vertically to fill the entire screen.\u003c/p>\u003ch2>IMAX DIGITAL, LASER AND EXHIBITOR PLF OPTIONS\u003c/h2>\u003cp>The vast majority of moviegoers in North America will have easier access to digital presentations. These include IMAX digital, which can sometimes mean a laser projected image and other times involves a retro formatted screen, and what’s called “exhibitor PLF,” meaning large format screen and projection systems developed by individual theater chains (like Regal RPX, Cinemark XD and Cineplex UltraAVX). When in doubt, look for an “X” in the name.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But don’t dismay: It’ll still look great, according to Nolan, whose team has worked for six months to digitize the original film for other formats to ensure the best experience on every screen.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This is the exciting thing about shooting an IMAX film: When you scan it for the digital format, you’re working with the absolute best possible image that you could acquire, and that translates wonderfully to the new projector formats like the laser projectors,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Nolan said the “IMAX impact” over the last 20 to 30 years has resulted in more theaters paying more attention to presentation, from projection to sound, which has been “great for filmmakers.”\u003c/p>\u003ch2>WHERE ARE THE BEST SEATS?\u003c/h2>\u003cp>Well, that comes down to personal preference but here’s where Nolan likes to sit.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“When I’m in a theater that’s Cinemascope ratio, I like to be right near the front, middle of the third row,” he said. “When I’m in a stadium, IMAX 1.43:1, then I actually like to be a little behind the center line right up at the middle. So, a little further back.”\u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":"2023-06-05 01:46:01","storyLayout":{},"reporters":[{"id":"afs:Reporter:111426101000","fullName":"Lindsey Bahr","displayName":"Lindsey

Rather than “setting it and forgetting it,” she encourages borrowers to reevaluate when their financial situation improves.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"social-embed\" id=\"se0:d2b4aac0-ed50-11ed-b31c-39e313565185\">\u003ciframe \nsrc=\" https://modules.wearehearken.com/associated-press/embed/10701/share \" \nheight=\"570\" style=\"border: none;\">\u003c/iframe> \u003cp class=\"social-caption\">\n\u003c/p>\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003ch2>WHAT'S AN INCOME-DRIVEN REPAYMENT PLAN? \u003c/h2>\u003cp>An income-driven repayment plan sets your monthly student loan payment at an amount that is intended to be affordable based on your income and family size. It takes into account different expenses in your budget, and most federal student loans are eligible for at least one of these types of plans. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Generally, your payment amount under an income-driven repayment plan is a percentage of your discretionary income. If your income is low enough, your payment could be as low as $0 per month.\u003c/p>\u003cp>If you’d like to repay your federal student loans under an income-driven plan, the first step is to \u003ca href=\"https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans/income-driven\">fill out an application through the Federal Student Aid website\u003c/a>. \u003c/p>\u003ch2>TALK TO AN ADVISER\u003c/h2>\u003cp>Fran Gonzales, 27, who is based in Texas, works as a supervisor for a financial institution. She holds $32,000 in public student loans and $40,000 in private student loans. During the payment pause on her public loans, Gonzales said she was able to pay off her credit card debt, buy a new car, and pay down two years’ worth of private loans while saving money. Her private student loan payment has been $500 a month, and her public student loan payment will be $350 per month when it restarts.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Gonzales recommends that anyone with student loans speak with a mentor or financial advisor to educate themselves about their options, as well as making sure they're in an income-driven repayment plan. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The \u003ca href=\"https://studentaid.gov/entrance-counseling/\">Federal Student Aid website can help direct you to counselors\u003c/a>, as well as organizations like the \u003ca href=\"https://protectborrowers.org/\">Student Borrower Protection Center\u003c/a> and \u003ca href=\"https://freestudentloanadvice.org/\">the Institute of Student Loan Advisors\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I was the first in my family to go to college, and I could have saved money with grants and scholarships had I known someone who knew about college,” she said. “I could have gone to community college or lived in cheaper housing … It’s a huge financial decision.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Gonzales received her degree in business marketing and says she was “horrible with finances” until she began working as a loan officer herself.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Gonzales's mother works in retail and her father for the airport, she said, and both encouraged her to pursue higher education. For her part, Gonzales now tries to inform others with student loans about what they're taking on and what their choices are. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Anyone young I cross paths with, I try to educate them.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003ch2>CAN I SET UP A PAYMENT PLAN FOR MY STUDENT LOANS?\u003c/h2>\u003cp>Yes — payment plans are always available. Even so, some advocates encourage borrowers to wait for now, since there’s no financial penalty for nonpayment during the pause on payments and interest accrual.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Katherine Welbeck of the Student Borrower Protection Center recommends logging on to your account and making sure you know the name of your servicer, your due date and whether you’re enrolled in the best income-driven repayment plan.\u003c/p>\u003ch2>WHAT IF I CAN'T PAY?\u003c/h2>\u003cp>If your budget doesn’t allow you to resume payments, it’s important to know how to navigate the possibility of default and delinquency on a student loan. Both can hurt your credit rating, which would make you ineligible for additional aid.\u003c/p>\u003cp>If you’re in a short-term financial bind, according to Mayotte, you may qualify for deferment or forbearance — allowing you to temporarily suspend payment. \u003c/p>\u003cp>To determine whether deferment or forbearance are good options for you, you can contact your loan servicer. One thing to note: interest still accrues during deferment or forbearance. Both can also impact potential loan forgiveness options. Depending on the conditions of your deferment or forbearance, it may make sense to continue paying the interest during the payment suspension. \u003c/p>\u003ch2>HOW CAN I REDUCE COSTS WHEN PAYING OFF MY STUDENT LOANS?\u003c/h2>\u003cp>— If you sign up for automatic payments, the servicer takes a quarter of a percent off your interest rate, according to Mayotte.\u003c/p>\u003cp>— Income-driven repayment plans aren’t right for everyone. That said, if you know you will eventually qualify for forgiveness under \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/pslf-public-service-loan-forgiveness-program-student-loans-e840af29f8879512199ed6fce226c722\">the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program\u003c/a>, it makes sense to make the lowest monthly payments possible, as the remainder of your debt will be cancelled once that decade of payments is complete.\u003c/p>\u003cp>— Reevaluate your monthly student loan repayment during tax season, when you already have all your financial information in front of you. “Can you afford to increase it? Or do you need to decrease it?” Mayotte said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>— Break up payments into whatever ways work best for you. You could consider two installments per month, instead of one large monthly sum.\u003c/p>\u003ch2>ARE STUDENT LOANS FORGIVEN AFTER 10 YEARS?\u003c/h2>\u003cp>If you’ve worked for a government agency or a nonprofit, the \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/education-philanthropy-student-loans-us-department-of-f9b57d058fc41ad8be7d1268e33c4718\">Public Service Loan Forgiveness program\u003c/a> offers cancellation after 10 years of regular payments, and some income-driven repayment plans cancel the remainder of a borrower’s debt after 20 to 25 years.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Borrowers should make sure they’re signed up for the best possible income-driven repayment plan to qualify for these programs. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Borrowers who have been defrauded by for-profit colleges may also apply for borrower defense and receive relief.\u003c/p>\u003cp>These programs won’t be affected by the Supreme Court ruling.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

In recent years, however, brutal killings by gangs and warring militant groups — many in broad daylight — have become commonplace. So, too, have fires, some of them acts of arson.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Beyond the spiralling security situation is worsening hunger. The Rohingya are banned from working and rely on food rations, which have been slashed due to a drop in global donations.

On Dec. 7, a woman on board Jamal’s boat named Setera Begum used the vessel’s satellite phone to make a frantic call to her husband, Muhammed Rashid, who was in Malaysia.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Rashid recorded the call and shared it with the AP.

Yet time after time, the Rohingya aboard those distressed boats were abandoned by governments in the region and left to die.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In many cases, the boats had satellite phones and officials therefore knew their precise locations. But even then, the UNHCR says maritime authorities in the region repeatedly ignored its pleas to rescue some of those vessels.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Governments ignore the Rohingya because they can. While multiple international laws mandate the rescue of vessels in distress, enforcement is difficult.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In the past, the region’s coastal nations hunted for boats in trouble — only to push them into other countries’ search and rescue zones, says Chris Lewa, director of the Arakan Project, which monitors the Rohingya crisis. But now, they rarely even bother to look.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The lucky ones are eventually towed to shore in Indonesia by local fishermen. Yet even rescue can be perilous — a Vietnamese oil company saved one boat, then promptly handed the Rohingya over to the same deadly regime in Myanmar from which they’d fled.\u003c/p>\u003cp>There is no reason why regional governments could not or cannot coordinate and rescue these boats, says John Quinley, director of human rights group Fortify Rights.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It was a total lack of political will and extremely heartless,” he says. “The accountability and the onus really lies on everyone.”\u003c/p>","sponsored":false,"contentBundle":null,"localMemberName":null,"media":[{"id":"78c653b06aa14a408d7df668ec2dbed0","type":"Photo","caption":"\u003cp>In this combination of photos, relatives hold images of some of those lost when their crowded boat carrying around 180 people sank in the sea south of Bangladesh on Dec. 7, 2022.

I didn’t know what I would say to Sasha, but in the end, it went really well.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, Subbotina said a year behind bars has been hard on Skochilenko.

He launched a food truck and catering business, Sol Familia Mobile Kitchen, with his wife. Everything was looking up, finally.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But Charles Thomas began to feel sick around Thanksgiving in 2020. He thought it was a passing cold, but his wife was worried; the number of COVID cases was climbing, both nationally and locally, and the vaccine wasn’t yet widely available.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Melanese was right. The entire family — parents and six children — would be diagnosed with COVID. But as the others got better, Charles’ condition worsened.\u003c/p>\u003cp>His wife convinced him to go to the hospital, where his oxygen levels dropped severely and he spent eight days in the intensive care unit, where he was nearly placed on a ventilator.

A woman who answered the phone told her it was a common pregnancy issue, Angelica said, and that she shouldn’t worry too much.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“She made me feel like my concern wasn’t important, and because this was my first pregnancy, I decided not to go because I wasn’t sure and thought maybe I was overreacting,” Angelica said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The pain persisted. She went to the hospital a few days later and was admitted. \u003c/p>\u003cp>She had an enema — a procedure where fluids are used to cleanse or stimulate the emptying of bowels — to alleviate her constipation, but Angelica continued to plead with them that she was in pain.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“They were like, ‘Oh, it’s nothing, it’s just the Braxton Hicks contractions,'\" she said. “They just ignored me.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>She was sent home but her stomach continued to ache, so she went back to the hospital a day later. Several tests, including MRIs, couldn’t find the source of the issue.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Angelica was eventually moved to the labor and delivery floor of the hospital so they could monitor her son’s heartbeat, which had dropped slightly. There, they performed another enema that finally helped with the pain. She also was diagnosed with preeclampsia, a dangerous condition that can cause severe pregnancy complications or death.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Then she began to vomit what appeared to be bile.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I got worse and worse with the pain and I kept telling them, ‘Hey, I’m in pain,’” Angelica said. “They’d say, ‘Oh, you want some Tylenol?’ But it wasn’t helping.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>She struggled to eat dinner that night. When she stood up to go to the bathroom, she felt a sharp pain ricochet throughout her body.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I started hollering because I had no idea what was going on,\" she said. \"I told my sister I was in so much pain and to please call the nurse.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>What happened next remains a blur. Angelica recalls the chaos of hospital staff rushing her to labor and delivery, putting up a blue sheet to prepare her for an emergency C-section as her family and ex-husband tried to understand what went wrong.\u003c/p>\u003cp>She later learned that she nearly died.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I was on life support,” recalled Angelica, 34. “I coded.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>She woke up three days later, unable to talk because of a ventilator in her mouth.

Black women are twice as likely to develop severe maternal sepsis, as compared to their white counterparts. Common symptoms can include fever or pain in the area of infection. \u003ca href=\"https://www.sepsis.org/news/maternal-sepsis-week-spotlight-laura-riley-md/\">Sepsis\u003c/a> can develop quickly, so a timely response is crucial. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Sepsis in its early stages can mirror common pregnancy symptoms, so it can be hard to diagnose. Due to a lack of training, some medical providers don’t know what to look for. But slow or missed diagnoses are also the result of bias, structural racism in medicine and inattentive care that leads to patients, particularly Black women, not being heard.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The way structural racism can play out in this particular disease is not being taken seriously,” said Dr. Laura Riley, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Weill Cornell Medicine and New York-Presbyterian Hospital. “We know that delay in diagnosis is what leads to these really bad outcomes.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>In the days and weeks that followed, Angelica demanded explanations from the medical staff of what happened. But she felt the answers she received on how it occurred were sparse and confusing. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>A spokesperson for the University of Alabama at Birmingham said in a statement to The Associated Press that they couldn’t talk about Angelica’s case because of patient privacy laws. They pointed to a recent internal survey done by its Obstetrics and Gynecology department that showed that most of its patients are satisfied with their care and “are largely feeling respected,” and said the university and hospital “maintain intentional, proactive efforts in addressing health disparities and maternal mortality.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Angelica’s son, Malik, was born eight weeks early, weighing under 5 pounds. He spent a month in intensive care. He received home visits through the first year of life to monitor his growth.\u003c/p>\u003cp>While he’s now a curious and vivacious 3-year-old who loves to explore the world around him, Angelica recalls those days in the ICU, and she feels guilty because she could not be with him.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s scary to know I could have died, that we could have died,” Lyons said, wiping away tears. ___\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"661e2cf9791c48e28a46b5b2e24ef16b\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv id=\"675e465ad96f4c5dac34eb613ffc392f\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv id=\"788f8f8878a1474bbc3a617f56eb3e83\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>For decades, frustrated birth advocates and medical professionals have tried to sound an alarm about the ways medicine has failed Black women. Historians trace that maltreatment to \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/medical-racism-history-bb1e7d18a811c6c3878fcdb7095f434b\">racist medical practices\u003c/a> that Black people endured amid and after slavery.\u003c/p>\u003cp>To fully understand maternal mortality and infant mortality crises for Black women and babies, the nation must first reckon with the dark history of how gynecology began, said Deirdre Cooper Owens, a \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Medical-Bondage-Origins-American-Gynecology/dp/0820351350\">historian and author\u003c/a>. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“The history of this particular medical branch … it begins on a slave farm in Alabama,” Owens said. “The advancement of obstetrics and gynecology had such an intimate relationship with slavery, and was literally built on the wounds of Black women.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Reproductive surgeries that were experimental at the time, like cesarean sections, were commonly performed on enslaved Black women.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Physicians like the once-heralded J. Marion Sims, an Alabama doctor many call the “father of gynecology,” performed torturous surgical experiments on enslaved Black women in the 1840s without anesthesia.\u003c/p>\u003cp>And well after the abolition of slavery, hospitals performed unnecessary hysterectomies on Black women, and eugenics programs sterilized them. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Health care segregation also \u003ca href=\"https://www.nichq.org/insight/impact-institutional-racism-maternal-and-child-health\">played a major role\u003c/a> in the racial health gap still experienced today.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Until Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Black families were mostly barred from well-funded white hospitals and often received limited, poor or inhumane medical treatment. Black-led clinics and doctors worked to fill in the gaps, but even after the new protections, hospitals once reserved for Black families remained under-resourced, and Black women didn’t get the same support regularly available for white women. \u003c/p>\u003cp>That history of abuse and neglect led to deep-rooted distrust of health care institutions among communities of color.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We have to recognize that it’s not about just some racist people or a few bad actors,” said Rana A. Hogarth, an associate professor of History at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. “People need to stop thinking about things like slavery and racism as just these features that happened that are part of the contours of history and maybe think of them more as foundational and institutions that have been with us every step of the way.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Some health care providers still hold \u003ca href=\"https://www.nichq.org/insight/impact-institutional-racism-maternal-and-child-health\">false beliefs\u003c/a> about biological differences between Black and white people, such as Black people having “less sensitive nerve endings, thicker skin, and stronger bones.” Those beliefs have caused medical providers today to rate Black patients’ pain lower, and recommend less relief.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The differences exist regardless of education or income level. Black women who have a college education or higher have a pregnancy-related mortality rate that is more than five times higher than that of white women. Notably, the pregnancy-related mortality rate for Black women with a college education is 1.6. times higher than that of white women with less than a high school degree.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"afs:Medium:057841894902\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>In Angelica Lyons’ home state of Alabama, about 40 mothers die within one year after delivery.

The disparities between Black and white babies is stark: The infant mortality rate in 2021 for white mothers was 5.8, while the infant mortality rate for Black mothers was 12.1, an increase from 10.9 from the prior year.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Black babies account for just 29% of births in Alabama, yet nearly 47% of infant deaths.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"social-embed\" id=\"se1:cee14df0-ed50-11ed-ecc9-9d9737f376a1\">\u003ciframe title=\"Death likelier for Black moms, babies\" aria-label=\"Grouped Bars\" id=\"ap-chart-wR4Up\" src=\"https://interactives.ap.org/embeds/wR4Up/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border:none\" height=\"302\">\u003c/iframe>\u003cscript type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\u003ct.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();\u003c/script>\u003cp class=\"social-caption\"> \u003c/p>\u003c/div>\u003cp>A 2020 report by the Alabama Maternal Mortality Review Committee found that more than 55% of 80 pregnancy-related deaths that they reviewed in 2016 and 2017 could have been prevented.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Alabama launched its Maternal Mortality Review Committee in 2018 to investigate maternal deaths.

They have higher rates of infant and maternal mortality, higher incidence of asthma during childhood, more difficulty treating mental illness as teens, and higher rates of high blood pressure, Alzheimer’s disease and other illness as adults. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Here are the key takeaways from each story:\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003ch2>WHY ARE BLACK BABIES AND MOTHERS MORE LIKELY TO DIE?\u003c/h2>\u003cp>Black women have the \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/black-women-maternal-mortality-rate-df872e86c4bb56ef222b19141dc377f8\">highest maternal mortality rate\u003c/a> in the United States — 69.9 per 100,000 live births for 2021, almost three times the rate for white women, according to \u003ca href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2021/maternal-mortality-rates-2021.htm#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20the%20maternal%20mortality,for%20White%20and%20Hispanic%20women.\">the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u003c/a> The 2021 rate was a significant increase from the prior year.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Black babies are also more likely to die, and also far more likely to be born prematurely, setting the stage for health issues that could follow them through their lives. In 2020, there were 364,487 preterm births in the nation, about 1 in 10. Preterm birth rates were highest for Black infants, 14.2%, between 2018 and 2020. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Multiple factors contribute to these disparities, according to the CDC and advocacy organizations, such as underlying health conditions. But more doctors and experts have pointed to the role of structural racism that has created inequitable access to health care, implicit bias and discriminatory care. Poor health care or outcomes for Black mothers in turn can create issues for their babies, putting them at risk for future health problems down the road.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003ch2>WHY DO MORE BLACK KIDS HAVE ASTHMA?\u003c/h2>\u003cp>Black children are \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/black-children-asthma-investigation-8892ec059a4b192b93eb38ccb613fcb9\">more likely to have asthma\u003c/a> and to be exposed to certain triggers, like mold and air pollution. Their asthma often is more severe and less likely to be controlled. About 4 million kids in the U.S. have asthma. The percentage of Black children with asthma is far higher than white kids; more than 12% of Black kids nationwide suffer from the disease, compared with 5% of white children. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Some of the high rates of asthma among Black children are tied to genetics — family histories of allergies, and frequent respiratory infections. But much of the disparity lies in the same racist factors that afflict Black peoples’ health from birth to death.\u003c/p>\u003cp>With asthma, especially for kids, where you live makes all the difference. And where you live often depends on your race. Black Americans are more at risk of living in homes with asthma triggers, like cockroaches, dust mites, mold and rodents. Research also shows that air pollution can worsen asthma.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Across America, nearly 4 in 10 Black children live in areas with poor environmental and health conditions compared to 1 in 10 white children. Factories spew nitrogen oxide and particulate matter. Idling trucks and freeway traffic kick up noxious fumes and dust.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The disparities are built into a housing system shaped by the longstanding effects of slavery and Jim Crow-era laws. Many of the communities that have substandard housing today or are located near toxic sites are the same as those that were segregated and redlined decades ago.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003ch2>HOW DOES RACISM AFFECT BLACK TEENS' MENTAL HEALTH?\u003c/h2>\u003cp>About 50% of Black youth experience moderate to severe symptoms of depression, and about 18% said they were exposed to racial trauma often or very often in their life.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mental-health-black-children-investigation-31a292733919a935929976e213aef2af\">drivers of the mental health crisis\u003c/a> for Black children begin early and persist through a lifetime. Black children’s first encounters with racism can start before they are even in school, and Black teenagers report experiencing an average of five instances of racial discrimination per day. Young Black students are often perceived as less innocent and older than their age, leading to disproportionately harsher discipline in schools.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Black adolescents are far less likely than their white peers to seek and find mental health care. In part, that’s because Black families often distrust the medical system after generations of mistreatment — from lack of access to care to being subjected to racist practices and experimentation. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The country also has a shortage of providers who understand the roles that racial identity and racism play in shaping young Black people’s mental health. Research and health surveillance data point to a growing mental health crisis among Black youth over decades. Between 1991 and 2019, Black adolescents had the highest increase among any other group in prevalence of suicide attempts — a rise of nearly 80%.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003ch2>WHAT ROLE HAS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE PLAYED IN COVID DEATHS OF BLACK AMERICANS?\u003c/h2>\u003cp>High blood pressure has played a major role in COVID deaths, and especially in the COVID deaths of Black people. Together, they have created a deadly combination: While it is listed as a contributing factor in 15.5% of the deaths of white COVID sufferers, the figure for Black victims is 21.4% — the highest of any racial group.\u003c/p>\u003cp>About 56% of \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/high-blood-pressure-covid-racism-370646e86ea8868d641aba9a67664c92\">Black adults have high blood pressure\u003c/a>, compared to 48% of white people. Three in four African Americans are likely to develop the disorder by age 55.\u003c/p>\u003cp>While only 32% of white adults with high blood pressure have their condition under control with medication, the figure for Black Americans is even lower — 25%.\u003c/p>\u003cp>And it’s likely to get worse: By 2060, the number of Americans battling cardiovascular disease is expected to drastically increase. High blood pressure rates alone are projected to rise 27.2%, or from roughly 127.8 million to 162.5 million Americans.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Among white people, the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and disease is projected to decrease over time. Yet significant increases are projected among people of color, especially Black and Latino Americans.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Like many conditions, genetics do play a part. Experts also blame poor diets, high cholesterol, obesity and smoking — risk factors that often exist at higher rates in Black communities. Also, in recent years, more academics and doctors have called attention to structural inequities that have an outsized impact. Black neighborhoods are more likely to experience a lack of access to healthy foods or be inundated with fast food options.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003ch2>WHY DO SO MANY BLACK PEOPLE DEVELOP ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE?\u003c/h2>\u003cp>Black Americans are more likely than white people \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/alzheimers-black-americans-f6e087e41e790404b3431febc461eafa\">to develop Alzheimer’s\u003c/a>. About 14% of Black Americans over the age of 65 have Alzheimer’s, compared with 10% of white Americans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Experts believe the rates could be even higher.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Health conditions like cardiovascular disease and diabetes experienced in earlier stages of life are known risk factors — both of which are more common among Black and Latino populations. Depression, high blood pressure, obesity and chronic stress are also risk factors. The CDC also acknowledges the impact of “higher rates of poverty, and greater exposure to adversity and discrimination” as risk factors.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Across the board, Black people are also unlikely to receive the health care that white people do — including necessary medication to treat Alzheimer’s and dementia-related disorders. A preliminary study released this year by Mount Sinai researchers found that Black people are less likely to receive dementia-related medications than white people.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Black and Latino populations are expected to rise in coming years, and so are the number of their cases of Alzheimer’s and related disorders. Cases among Black Americans are projected to increase four times over today’s estimates and Latino Americans could increase seven times, according to the CDC.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Some advocates estimate that by 2030, nearly 40% of all Americans living with Alzheimer’s could be Black or Latino. But the projected rise in cases isn’t just tied to population growth.\u003c/p>\u003cp>While evidence exists that certain genetic risk factors could differ by race and be a driver, the large disparities among racial groups can’t be explained just by genetics, experts say.\u003c/p>\u003cp>And the sheer trauma of experiencing racism is also believed to be a contributing factor.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Kat Stafford, based in Detroit, is a national investigative race writer for the AP’s Race and Ethnicity team.

Reigning over the shop was its owner, Constance Guthrie.\u003c/p>\u003cp>She traveled the world, attending hair shows. She opened her salon to fashion shows like the “Tall, Full and Sassy” event advertised in an old flyer she now keeps in a box of mementos. She donned dazzling, colorful and flamboyant outfits to match her larger-than-life personality. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In the 1990s, she made the difficult decision to move and close her beloved salon. She bought a home in Fredericksburg so her daughter could attend the best schools, and later became a paraprofessional in the local school district, which allowed her to have a schedule where she never missed oratorical contests or choir recitals. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"social-embed\" id=\"se2:e8cd9ca0-ed50-11ed-bf49-3b7bdcd235da\">\u003cdiv style=\"position:relative;overflow:hidden;padding-bottom:56.25%\">\u003ciframe src=\"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/players/PEOFhjRl-oOPvcXwU.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"auto\" title=\"A daughter sings to spark her mother's memory\" style=\"position:absolute;\" allowfullscreen>\u003c/iframe>\u003c/div>\u003cp class=\"social-caption\"> \u003c/p>\u003c/div>\u003cp>She was always there for Jessica, who is her only child.

Despite meager means, Jessica grew up surrounded by encouragement and love.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“My mother gave up everything to make sure that I had the greatest support, the greatest opportunities,” Jessica Guthrie recalled. “We were like two peas in a pod.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Her mother’s hard work paid off. Jessica became a teacher and later moved to Dallas to build her own life and chase her dreams, where she was a successful chief program officer for an education service.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Then, seven years ago, Constance began her descent into dementia.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"fb5323449e624ac68a7da9b1a1cba90a\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>She started to forget simple things, like where her keys were. She lost her way coming home from work on a familiar route she traveled almost daily for 18 years. She got into a car accident.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The frequency of troubling incidents began to increase, worrying Jessica who was still hundreds of miles away in Texas. \u003c/p>\u003cp>They tried to use Post-it notes to remind Constance of daily tasks. Some of the colorful notes still line the walls of the family’s home. \u003c/p>\u003cp>For a woman who had grown accustomed to being so independent, it was hard for her to accept that she needed help.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“She spent so long trying to hide it,” Jessica said. “Like, ‘Oh, I’m good, I’m fine. I just forgot.’ But you could tell that a lot of her anxiety and stress was because she was trying to cover this up from other people.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>She began to wander around her neighborhood. Jessica and nearby loved ones tried to bolt the door to prevent her from wandering. \u003c/p>\u003cp>A neurologist confirmed she was suffering early cognitive decline and that it was likely Alzheimer’s.\u003c/p>\u003cp>She was just 66 when she was diagnosed. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"4ade92d4a8d2499d829830001f05169e\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv id=\"8c8a475b6cec424b8f133ddd09675f25\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Soon after, Jessica made the tough decision to pack up and leave Dallas behind to care for her mother full time. She recently began working remotely again after taking an extended leave of absence to care for her mother. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Constance never had diabetes nor high blood pressure — which are common risk factors. She was fairly active and healthy, and would often walk around her neighborhood. But in 2015, Constance suffered a transient ischaemic attack, or a “mini stroke,” which is a brief disruption in the blood supply to part of the brain. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Jessica believes the mini stroke could have been caused in part by the heavy stress her mother endured at her job, where she worked for 18 years as a special education paraprofessional.\u003c/p>\u003cp>She also questions the role genetics played in her mother’s diagnosis. Her mother’s aunts are all living with the disease.

But the pain persisted. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Jessica took her mother to the emergency room the next day and a Black male doctor ordered the necessary imaging. She needed emergency surgery to correct a painful, protruding hernia.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Then there was the time she took her mother to the emergency room for intense leg pain. She had arthritis in her knee but Jessica suspected something more serious. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The doctor told her she likely just needed rehab for her bad knee. Jessica advocated for more testing and it turned out Constance had a blood clot in her leg.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"a94a68fd7aa441bca344d5c502322f6e\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“Racism is implicit and deeply rooted in the air that we breathe,” said Jessica, who has started an Instagram account to chronicle her experiences. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The problems Black people face getting medical care are pervasive.

Part of the problem is a lack of Black doctors. Just 1 in 3 of the nation’s physicians is Black, Indigenous, Hispanic or Asian. That lack of representation has had a compounding effect on the care that Black people receive — especially later in life when older Americans suffering from illnesses like Alzheimer’s lack the ability to advocate for themselves. \u003c/p>\u003cp>All these things put an outsized burden on Black families providing care.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Through her Instagram, Jessica regularly hears from other Black caregivers, mostly women, who have eerily similar stories of not being heard, feeling isolated or being denied proper treatment.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"049bd719fdef4941baf4478975cba7f9\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“I think that part of my journey would have looked significantly different if I were a middle-aged white person or a white male,” she said. “I would have been listened to the first time.” ___ Jessica has spent the past several months preparing for her mother’s imminent death, making sure every detail is perfect.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But in an unexpected twist, she learned in February that her mother would be discharged from home hospice care in early March.

It’s been nine months at least in the preparation in the sense that they’ve had to gather weapons and ammunition from NATO. Not enough, I think, so far.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>Barrons, who is co-chair of the consulting group Universal Defence &amp; Security Solutions, noted Russia has bolstered its forces, replenished some of its ammunition stockpiles and built complex defensive lines.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Russia has had time to lay out a textbook fixed defense,” he said, with three lines of trenches and held-down positions allowing tanks to come forward to fire at the attackers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\"They will have rehearsed the artillery fire plan in support of defending those lines, and they will have rehearsed the crucial rapid counterattacks, which are so vital when you are trying to restore a line that’s being attacked,” Barrons added.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He predicted Ukraine will try to focus its nine newly formed brigades armed with Western weapons to ram through Russian defenses in just one, two or three places, trying to concentrate their forces to have a significant numerical superiority “in order to smash their way through and then exploit and hold on to the ground that they’ve taken.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The offensive “is going to be, in a land sense, quite a narrow frontage,” he said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\"I’d be surprised if it’s more than 20 miles, to be honest,” Barrons added. “The battlefield success has to be enough to show hope and prospect to bind in further strategic support.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>He emphasized the Russian army has learned from its setbacks last fall when it retreated from large areas in the Kharkiv and Kherson regions under the brunt of a Ukrainian counteroffensive, noting it could be more challenging this time for Ukraine to push the Russians out.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The thing that is most important about this offensive is whenever it comes, however successful it is, it is simply not possible for it to throw every Russian out of Ukraine unless the Russians decided to give up and go,” Barrons said. “And they are not going to do that.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The West must mobilize its military industries to ramp up support for Ukraine to allow it to win, he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The key to this counteroffensive is to show enough battlefield success to show to the West that the right and reasonable thing to do is to get on with industrial mobilization,” Barrons said, estimating that Europe must spend about 100 billion euros ($107 billion) a year for the next three years.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Associated Press writers Danica Kirka in London, Yuras Karmanau in Tallinn, Estonia, and Tara Copp in Washington

Washington likely does hope to leverage its security relationship with Saudi Arabia as it gets warmer with China and Russia. However, the Saudis likely want guarantees that Biden can't provide when it comes to Congress stopping arms sales to the kingdom, Ibish said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Khashoggi still haunts the halls of Congress.

The prince also hosted Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, a longtime foe of America, for a meeting late Monday, Saudi state television reported. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Outside of meeting Prince Mohammed and other Saudi officials, Blinken also will attend an anti-Islamic State meeting in Riyadh and meet with foreign ministers from the Gulf Cooperation Council. The six-nation GCC includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“A deeper diplomatic engagement by the United States is likely to produce better outcomes in the long run than simply washing our hands and pulling back from the region,” wrote Brian Katulis, the vice president of policy for the Washington-based Middle East Institute. \u003c/p>\u003cp>However, the challenges are many.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Yemen war continues despite prisoner swaps and efforts to end the conflict. Meanwhile, both sides likely have wants that won't be fulfilled. Saudi Arabia increasingly has pushed for a nuclear cooperation that includes America allowing it to enrich uranium in the kingdom — something that worries nonproliferation experts as spinning centrifuges opens the door to a possible weapons program. Prince Mohammed has said the kingdom would pursue a nuclear weapon if Iran had one. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Blinken on Monday night told a meeting of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee that the Biden administration continues to believe “that diplomacy is the best way to verifiably, effectively, and sustainably prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.” However, he added: “All options are on the table to ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Blinken first traveled to Saudi Arabia as America's top diplomat last year as part of Biden’s trip there. That trip saw Biden fly directly from Israel to the kingdom.

Of the nine states where federal review had been required before the court ruling, all but one saw their statewide voter turnout decline for the 2022 midterm elections compared with the previous midterms four years earlier — but that also mirrored the trend nationally, according to an analysis of election and population data maintained by the AP.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Some of the states passing new restrictions also do have election policies that are voter-friendly, such as offering early voting and mail voting without needing an excuse.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The Shelby opinion stands for the basic idea that if the federal government is going to take the drastic step of usurping the constitutionally endorsed power of states to govern their own elections, it must do so based on real and current data,” said Jason Snead, executive director of the Honest Elections Project. “By any objective measure, elections are free, fair, and accessible.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Voting rights groups say that does not mean voting is easy, and they have been responding to the restrictions with fresh strategies. In Georgia, for instance, Common Cause set up mobile printing stations across the state so voters could comply with new voter registration rules that require an ink signature on a printed form.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"16f79fa9da3f423b84a6b8beb0a5c2e5\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“It’s only through the work of all these communities and groups on the ground that voters have access,\" said Sylvia Albert, the group’s national director of voting and elections. \"But doing this post-Shelby, courts are not recognizing the true damage those laws have had.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Supreme Court weakened another section of the Voting Rights Act two years ago with \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/us-supreme-court-arizona-voting-voting-rights-race-and-ethnicity-1a63621d6ebaa55e5ebae6c1fd02ae09\">a ruling\u003c/a> in a case from Arizona. It sided with the state in a challenge to new regulations that restricted who can return early ballots for another person and prohibited ballots cast in the wrong precinct from being counted. The conservative majority court could further erode voting rights that are intended to protect racial minorities in an Alabama case in which the plaintiffs argue \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/voting-rights-2022-midterm-elections-us-supreme-court-health-951245afb2827282e9c340417ca02375\">the state diluted the power of Black voters\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Under Alabama’s Republican-drawn congressional map, just one of seven districts has a majority Black population in a state where more than one in four residents is Black.

Journalists, academics and politicians — the users who helped make Twitter into the culture's zeitgeist — are also flocking to the app (if they can score invite codes).\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>“Really wondering about where the line is to leave the other place,” wrote — or “skeeted” Ocasio-Cortez recently, expressing concern about how Musk's Twitter will handle next year's presidential elections. “There's a line where the harm of unchecked disinfo exceeds the benefits of direct, authentic communication. It's really sad.” \u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"afs:Card:184428044543\" content-id=\"f2b4fb2fefd34f0149cec2d87857c766\" class=\"hub-peek-embed\">Hub peek embed (ElonMusk) - Compressed layout (automatic embed)\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Bluesky, though, has bigger ambitions than to simply supplant Twitter. Beyond the social network itself, it is building the technical foundation — what it calls “a protocol for public conversation\" — that could make social networks work more like email, blogs or phone numbers. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In computer science, protocols are technical rules for processing and transmitting data, shared standards to which everyone agrees to adhere. Without the TCP/IP protocol, for instance, we wouldn’t have the internet. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>When you call someone on the phone, it doesn’t matter if they use Verizon or AT&amp;T or Cricket Wireless — as long as their phone has service, they can pick up and talk to you. But on Facebook, or TikTok, or Twitter, you can’t cross over to another social network to leave a comment on someone’s account. Twitter users must stay on Twitter and TikTok users must stay on TikTok if they want to interact with accounts on those services.\u003c/p>\u003cp>There’s no crossing over — no interoperability. Big Tech companies have largely built moats around their online properties, which helps serve their advertising-focused business models. Your Twitter friends are your Twitter friends, and if you move on to a new social network, you can’t easily bring them with you — if you can bring them at all. Bluesky is trying to reimagine all this. Moonshot or delusion, what is clear is that invites to the Bluesky social networking app are hot commodity, some even offered on eBay for $100 or more. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>But as everyone — including Musk, who paid $44 billon for Twitter — knows, a social network's value is not simply in the technology behind it. It is in the people — the network of people who use and contribute to a platform. And getting people, especially people who aren't teenagers, to move to a new social network, is quite a challenge. Just ask \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-twitter-inc-business-6e8bff97bb33d53b87c3d9a7c6a509cf\">Mastodon\u003c/a>, Truth Social or any other alternative network that's sprung up more recently. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“We are all active on Twitter because we are all active on Twitter. And so it’s very, very difficult to to migrate to a different social media platform once you have thousands of followers on Twitter,” said Messing, who also worked on data science at Facebook and the Pew Research Center. \u003c/p>\u003cp>While it seems unlikely that Bluesky could replace Twitter as a global information conduit any time soon, it is more intuitive and easy to use than 7-year-old Mastodon, which not long ago was touted as a possible Twitter replacement but which many find befuddlingly complicated and lacking in important features. While it looks and feels similar to Twitter, Bluesky lacks many of the features Twitter has built out over the years. There is no way to send direct messages, for instance, and there is no verification system.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For now, Bluesky is like the back room at a house party where the cool kids and misfits found refuge from the increasingly rowdy rager out front — at least until it, too, is enveloped by chaos. Fewer than 100,000 people are on it right now. That's by design. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Once you open it up and allow different forms of content moderation to dominate, it’s going to be a very different platform,” Messing said. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Bluesky's approach to content moderation is similar to its approach to algorithms to decide what users see. That is, giving users a choice in what they see. The app launched with a chronological feed, meaning you see posts in the order they are posted in. Other social platforms like TikTok, Facebook, Instagram or Twitter use secretive algorithms to show you what you’re more likely to be interested in. Bluesky also has “custom feeds,” which let users pick the algorithm that controls what they see. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Imagine you want your timeline to only be posts from your mutuals, or only posts that have cat photos, or only posts related to sports — you can simply pick your feed of choice from an open marketplace,” CEO Jay Graber wrote in a recent \u003ca href=\"https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-30-2023-algorithmic-choice\">blog post\u003c/a>. Bluesky did not respond to a request for comment. \u003c/p>\u003cp>It's an open question whether Bluesky will soar or remain a pie in the sky. But some of Twitter's earliest supporters are cautiously optimistic. After all, Twitter started out similarly small, and along the way both its creators and users learned a lot. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"dbcca011d0184b1e8094acc4c19ef0c6\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“There’s a whole community of people doing these experiments at these projects that are all learning from each other and sharing things back and forth and with the overall hope and idea that we cannot make the same mistakes we made last time,” said Evan “Rabble” Henshaw-Plath, who worked on Twitter predecessor Odeo with Dorsey and is now CEO of Planetary.Social, another decentralized social network. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“In some ways, we democratized the media. We changed the world. We gave everyone a voice. But we didn’t figure out what to do with that,” he said. “We didn’t give ourselves great tools to handle it.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Could Bluesky be the Twitter do-over it was set up to be? \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I would like to see these guys figure out a smart way to maintain data portability, without losing the ability to essentially moderate content,” Henshaw-Plath said. “And yeah, that might be impossible, but that’s what I would ultimately like to see.” \u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{},"reporters":[{"id":"afs:Reporter:925862147941","fullName":"Barbara

Wait, a jukebox musical on top of Shakespeare? \u003c/p>\u003cp>“There’s a healthy amount of doubt that everyone has when you first hear about this piece. We’ve seen jukebox musicals before. I’ve been in them,” she says. “But there’s something about this one — it’s truly a unicorn.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Wolfe plays Williams Shakespeare’s wife, Anne, who in playwright David West Read's book challenges her husband to change Juliet's story for future generations, and it changes her life, too. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"86506af614bd4fec8bb4c807a4705cfb\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“Women often shrink themselves — to not intimidate, to not threaten their partner. And so to be able to come out within the first five minutes of the show and not do any of that, but just be fearless, saying, ‘I think we can make this better.’”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Wolfe, whose Broadway credits include “Waitress” and “Bullets Over Broadway” and revivals of “Falsettos” and “The Mystery of Edwin Drood,” has often played a girlfriend or a wife of a more successful artist but is one of the two heroines now. “Where most of my roles have seemingly ended in the first five pages, this one began.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The musical's crowning achievement is its ability to use massive pop hits by Max Martin, who had a hand in Backstreet Boys' “Larger Than Life,” Kelly Clarkson's “Since U Been Gone,” Celine Dion's “That’s The Way It Is” and Justin Timberlake's “Can’t Stop the Feeling.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>In one special move, Spears' “I’m Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman” is sung by Juliet’s nonbinary friend, May, played by genderqueer Justin David Sullivan.

She was six months pregnant when the pandemic began, and Poppy was 18 months old when Wolfe agreed to do the show, taking the family to Toronto during its first runs. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I knew that the projects that I would choose from here on out would be shaped by the fact that it had to be worth the time and the sacrifice that it takes from all parties involved. And this story in particular just really spoke to me,” she says. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I went in doubting how it could possibly work and honestly, by Page 3, maybe four, I was cracking up and I had this feeling in my gut that this was the next show that I wanted to do. This was the story I wanted to tell, and this was a show that I needed to see.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Some audience members have walked out on her show, unhappy with the direction of a feminist “Romeo and Juliet” or the pro-transgender-rights theme.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“Occasionally, for some people it’s too much. And that’s OK. But the point is this: I think that we’re pushing the conversation forward in a thoughtful way,” she says. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Stark Sands, who plays William Shakespeare, calls Wolfe “the best scene partner I could ever ask for.” He says she's playful, genuinely funny and surprising — constantly trying new ways to deliver. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“She knew that when she looked in the audience and saw moms and their daughters watching this, she knew what it could mean,” he says. “This is her opportunity to have an impact in a story about empowerment.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>On Sunday, Wolfe faces-off in the category of best performance by an actress in a featured role in a musical with Julia Lester from “Into the Woods,” Ruthie Ann Miles in “Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,” Bonnie Milligan of “Kimberly Akimbo” and NaTasha Yvette Williams from “Some Like It Hot.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>But even if she doesn't win, she's gotten the approval of one person that means the world to her — her daughter. Poppy just saw the show for the first time, loves singing “Roar” and hanging out with Juliet, played by Lorna Courtney. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I was thinking like, ‘Oh, this will be so enlightening.’ Like, ‘She’ll get to see this really cool rewrite.’ And what’s even sweeter for me is this just might be the world that she thinks is normal,” Wolfe says.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This is not a rewrite for her. This is the world and how beautiful that this story becomes her normal.

He did not provide additional details. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Born in Salvador, Bahia and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Gilberto became an overnight, unexpected superstar in 1964, thanks to knowing just enough English to be recruited by the makers of “Getz/Gilberto,” the classic bossa nova album featuring saxophonist Stan Getz and her then-husband, singer-songwriter-guitarist João Gilberto.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The Girl from Ipanema,” the wistful ballad written by Antônio Carlos Jobim and Vinícius de Moraes, was already a hit in South America. But “Getz/Gilberto” producer Creed Taylor and others thought they could expand the record’s appeal by including both Portuguese and English language vocals. In a 2002 interview with friends posted on her web site \u003ca href=\"www.astrudgilberto.com\">www.astrudgilberto.com\u003c/a>, Astrud Gilberto remembered her husband saying he had a surprise for her at the recording studio.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>“I begged him to tell me what it was, but he adamantly refused, and would just say: ‘Wait and see ...’ Later on, while rehearsing with Stan, as they were in the midst of going over the song ‘The Girl from Ipanema,’ Joao casually asked me to join in, and sing a chorus in English, after he had just sung the first chorus in Portuguese. So, I did just that,” she explained.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“When we were finished performing the song, Joao turned to Stan, and said something like: ‘Tomorrow Astrud sing on record… What do you think?’ Stan was very receptive, in fact very enthusiastic; he said it was a great idea. The rest, of course, as one would say, ‘is history.’”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Astrud Gilberto sings “The Girl from Ipanema” in a light, affectless style that influenced Sade and Suzanne Vega among others, as if she had already moved on to other matters. But her words, translated from the Portuguese by Norman Gimbel, would be remembered like few others from the era.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Tall and tan and young and lovely\u003c/p>\u003cp>The girl from Ipanema goes walking\u003c/p>\u003cp>And when she passes\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Each one she passes goes, “Ah”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>“Getz/Gilberto” sold more than 2 million copies and “The Girl from Ipanema,” released as a single with Astrud Gilberto the only vocalist, became an all-time standard, often ranked just behind “Yesterday” as the most covered song in modern times. “The Girl from Ipanema” won a Grammy in 1965 for record of the year and Gilberto received nominations for best new artist and best vocal performance. The poised, dark-haired singer was so closely associated with “The Girl from Ipanema” that some assumed she was the inspiration; de Moraes had written the lyrics about a Brazilian teenager, Heloísa Eneida Menezes Paes Pinto. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Over the next few years, Gilberto toured with Getz among others and released eight albums (with songs in English and Portuguese), among them “The Astrud Gilberto Album,” “Beach Samba” and “The Shadow of Your Smile.” But after 1969, she made just seven more albums and by 2002 had essentially retired from the business and stopped giving interviews, dedicating her latter years to animal rights activism and a career in the visual arts. She would allege that she received no money for “The Girl from Ipanema” and that Taylor and Getz (who would refer to her as “just a housewife”) took undue credit for “discovering” her. She also felt estranged from her native country, alleging she was treated dismissively by the press, and rarely performed there after she became a star.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Isn’t there an ancient proverb to the effect that ‘No one is a prophet in his own land?’” she said in 2002. ”I have no qualms with Brazilians, and I enjoy myself very much when I go to Brazil. Of course, I go there as an incognito visitor, and not as a performer.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Astrud Weinert was the youngest of three sisters, born into a family both musical and at ease with foreign languages: Her mother was a singer and violinist, her father a linguistics professor. By her teens, she was among a circle of musical friends and had met João Gilberto, a rising star in Rio’s emerging bossa nova scene.\u003c/p>\u003cp>After she met him, “The clan grew larger, to include ‘older’ folks” such as Tom Jobim, Vinícius de Moraes, Bené Nunes, Luis Bonfá and João Donato, and other respective \"'other halves,'” she recalled. “(João Gilberto) and I used to sing duets, or he would accompany me on guitar. Friends would always request that I sing at these gatherings, as well as at our own home when they would come to visit us.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>She was married twice and had two sons, João Marcelo Gilberto and Gregory Lasorsa, both of whom would work with her. Well after her commercial peak, she remained a popular live act, her singing becoming warmer and jazzier as she sang both covers and original material. She also had some notable moments as a recording artist, whether backed by trumpeter Chet Baker on “Fly Me to the Moon” or crooning with George Michael on the bossa nova standard “Desafinado.” In 2008, she received a Latin Grammy for lifetime achievement.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I have been labeled by an occasional frustrated journalist as ‘a recluse.’ The dictionary clearly defines recluse as ‘a person who withdraws from the world to live in seclusion and often in solitude.’ Why should anybody assume that just because an artist chooses not to give interviews, he/she is a recluse?” she said in 2002.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I firmly believe that any artist who becomes famous through their work — be it music, motion pictures or any other — does not have any moral obligation to satisfy the curiosity of journalists, fans or any members of the public about their private lives, or anything else that does not have any direct reflection on their work. My work, whether perceived as good, bad, or indifferent, speaks for itself.”\u003c/p>","sponsored":false,"contentBundle":null,"localMemberName":null,"media":[{"id":"bd40de76e5054821b1b90e96e0110d3d","type":"Photo","caption":"\u003cp>FILE - Brazilian vocalist Astrud Gilberto poses for a photo in New York on Aug. 20, 1981.

They’ve turned seemingly terrible ideas — a Lego movie, a “21 Jump Street” movie — into original works of antic, innovative comedy. One of their crowning achievements, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/caf272445f4c426797e6093b2b3c7945\">the Oscar-winning “Into the Spider-Verse,”\u003c/a> took a hatchet to superhero movie conventions.

It might be their masterpiece. In “Across the Spider-Verse\" — \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/across-spider-verse-movie-review-7d6e8ebb158b88bc8c86ef482ef9142f\">an eyeball-delighting, electrically animated whirligig of color and sound \u003c/a> — Lord and Miller set out not just to surpass the high bar of their 2018 original but upend big-studio animation and the more-of-the-same expectations of sequel-making.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“It was an opportunity to show the limitless possibilities of animation in a studio film,” says Miller. “For too long, the studios were mandating that these films all look the same. And we wanted to blow the doors open on that.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Across the Spider-Verse\" certainly blasted expectations on opening weekend. It \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/spiderman-across-spiderverse-box-office-b618e5cbf841e33c829ea542f35383cb\">debuted with $120.5 million\u003c/a>, way above tracking estimates and more than triple what “Into the Spider-Verse” launched with. What was once a quirky minor player in the hulking world of superhero movies has turned into not just a blockbuster but a genuine pop-culture sensation and, maybe, a new high point in comic-book movies.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“When you have the confidence of the audience like I hope we have from the first movie, you sort of want to use it as a springboard to take more chances,” says Lord. “We couldn’t justify doing this with any other story or any other point in our careers. We were like: Let’s swing the biggest bat we can.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Across the Spider-Verse,” directed by Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers and Justin K. Thompson, continues the story of Miles, now a veteran crime-fighter but also a teenager with an increasingly strained relationship with his parents. They remain unaware of his secret identity.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"f76e82b3fead4dc1b1a59d63ee8266df\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>But much isn’t straightforward in “Across the Spider-Verse,\" which Lord and Miller penned with David Callaham. There are countless other parallel Earths, each with their own Spider-Person. One is Gwen (Hailee Steinfeld), Spider-Man’s traditional love interest who’s now a potent force, herself. Worlds collide, many times over. \u003c/p>\u003cp>There’s also a Spidey collective that keep these universes in balance by making sure certain canonical moments happen for each hero. There may be wide latitude in who can be Spider-Man, but a foundation of formula must be obeyed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>This battle with Canon is in many ways Lord and Miller’s fight, too. They’ve spent their careers deconstructing convention and inverting tropes. They have sometimes pushed right up against Hollywood's limits. In mid-production on “Solo,” the Han Solo standalone “Star Wars” film, they were famously replaced after \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-lawrence-kasdan-chris-miller-ap-top-news-france-87f83207e40048fe85693bab6ebf96c5\">a clash over the film's tone. \u003c/a>\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“Across the Spider-Verse,” a part two ending in an abrupt cliffhanger, plunges directly into the question: So what is gospel for Lord and Miller? Is anything?\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Who seeks to become an artist in order to be a column that upholds the temple?” says Lord, laughing. “That’s no fun.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The “Solo” kerfuffle might have been their “Network” moment. (“You have meddled with the primal forces of nature, Mr. Beale.”) Instead, Lord and Miller have, if anything, doubled down on their devotion to tearing up Hollywood playbooks. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“We have a natural aversion to the dangers of nostalgia. It can be a calcifying effect on people,” says Miller. “There’s a lot of anger and hate coming out of wanting to preserve things the way they’ve always been. That’s not how society works. We need to keep evolving and making things new and growing. We can’t just perfectly preserve the past.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The movies you love were all daring in their time,” adds Lord. “The idea isn’t to copy them. It’s to be as equally daring as ‘Snow White’ or ‘Toy Story’ or ‘Jaws.’”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Their collage-like films, like Michael Rianda's family road trip “The Mitchells vs. The Machines,” are often in some way contemplating humanity in increasingly digital worlds. Lord and Miller were behind the meme-turned-movie “Cocaine Bear” earlier this year. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Set to a modern hip-hop beat and chock-full of ever-changing shocks of color that channel the 2-D art of comic books, “Across the Spider-Verse\" summons multiverses with the ease of a keystroke. But it does so far more playfully, disorderly and distinctly un-algorithm-like. Striving for originality, they say, is \"how to keep the robots guessing.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>“The AI isn’t going to generate something new and original,” says Miller, who along with Lord, is an outspoken Writers Guild member in \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/screen-actors-strike-authorization-vote-5ae02cee343eb0077eaaf8d64a2f4769\">the current strike\u003c/a> where \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ai-hollywood-writers-strike-artificial-intelligence-dc71c4cabcca0ee1b1afe0050d392a36\">artificial intelligence is a top issue\u003c/a>. “It’s going to just do an imitation of the things that came before it. It’s our job as humans to keep making things new.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"b65126933adb4dc595a805f5144d2f16\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>But as dizzying as “Across the Spider-Verse” can be visually, the imagery is ultimately in service of its central characters' inner lives. To the 28-year-old Moore, Miles’ appeal isn’t that he’s exceptional. It’s that he’s recognizably ordinary.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“There are young Black kids that are just like Miles. Regular, cool, kinda nerdy, weird, loveable kids. Same thing on the Hispanic side,” says Moore. “People want to meet him. My lines at Comic-Con are insane.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Moore never received a script for either film, just a sense of major plot points. Three times a month, for four years, he would go into a recording booth for six-hour sessions with Lord, Miller and the directors. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“They’ll play with it for hours. We’ll do another session where they lock in on whatever they like the most and then they’ll play with it again. It’s really like they’re having fun, more than anything,” says Moore. “The whole project is being treated like a passion project. It doesn’t feel like someone is watching over them.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"3b32415a471b4b19acfe866a6c529801\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>At the same time, “Across the Spider-Verse” grapples with not just the responsibilities of Spider-Man (Miles) but of his anxious, doubting parents (Brian Tyree Henry and Luna Lauren Vélez) and Gwen’s disapproving father (Shea Whigham). It’s a coming-of age-story, but as Miller says, “the parents have to come of age, too.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“And what makes someone legitimate?” says Lord. “Do you seek that outside of yourself? Or can you simply seek your own approval? Miles is like all of us hoping for validation outside. But it can never really satisfy you. You have to take it on yourself. Even though the movie ends in a cliffhanger, I think that’s what he achieves. It’s an epic action movie where the story is really internal. He’s the MacGuffin.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Some of the same questions exist for Lord and Miller, both 47 and increasingly prominent power players with a long pipeline of projects in development. Later this summer they have the R-rated dog comedy “Strays\" in theaters.

As the movie stutters on, the robots seem to soften only when the beasts show up for the last third — they mourn, get angry, feel protective, love even.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The filmmakers also have tried to bridge the divide with none other than Pete Davidson, who voices the juvenile robot Mirage, a wisecracking, fist-bumping silver Porsche 911 with a less rigid way of expression: “Don't mess with my boy!” and “Prime, you got to learn how to relax, my man.” It mostly works — best line: “I'm not scared. That's just engine oil!” — but Davidson seems trapped inside that steel.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The special effects are astounding but sometimes numbing at the same time. The beasts — especially a nostril-flaring gorilla — are gorgeously realized and the baddies look cool as they control elements in space and time, like building sky walkways as they move on them. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Setting the movie in 1994 gives the filmmakers some vintage fun, like adding beepers and references to O.J. Simpson, plus a soundtrack including A Tribe Called Quest and LL Cool J. But even here they get stuff wrong, like using Biggie's “Hypnotize,” which came out in 1996, and having a character sing “Waterfalls” by TLC a year before it came out. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"0a45ab011dad485ca42b93c5eae9eb37\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The Autobots are represented by Optimus Prime (voiced by veteran Peter Cullen), Bumblebee and Arcee (voiced by Liza Koshy).

Just like the robots, their scenes are overly heightened and overacted, like an intense bubble of distilled humanity between giant robot fights. It's not clear even what their relationship is — more siblings? Would-be-lovers? \u003c/p>\u003cp>Much too late come the titular stars of the show — the beasts. There's Optimus Primal, a 13-foot-tall metallic silverback gorilla voiced by Ron Perlman; Cheetor, a cheetah the size of a small truck voiced by Tongayi Chirisa; Airazor, a peregrine falcon who shoots fire, voiced by Michelle Yeoh; and Rhinox, a battering ram on legs, voiced by David Sobolov.
